Charlie Aarons,HE LOVED YOUNG MARSTER JOHN,"Charlie Aarons
Personal contact with Uncle Charlie Aarons
Oak Grove, Alabama
â€”
Written by Mary A. Poole
Some friends driving to Oak Grove, Ala., gave the writer the opportunity
on August 4th to interview an old ex-slave, Charlie Aarons, who is quite
venerable in appearance, and who, when asked his age, replied:
""Madam I don't know but I sure been 'round here long time"", and when
asked how old he was at the time of the Surrender he answered:
""I was a man able to do a man's work so I 'spects I was eighteen or
twenty years old.""
Uncle Charlie, as he is known among his own color and the white people
who know him, told the writer he was born at Petersburg Va., and his
parents, Aaron and Louisa, were owned by a Mr. J.H. White, who had a
store in the city, but no plantation. His parents had three children,
two boys and one girl, and when Uncle Charlie was about ten years of
age, he was sold by Mr. White to a speculator named Jones who brought
him to Mobile. He recalled being placed on the block, at the slave mart
on Royal and State streets, and the anxiety of hearing the different
people bidding for him, and being finally sold to a Mr. Jason Harris,
who lived near Newton Station in Jasper County, Miss.
Uncle Charlie never saw or heard of his parents or brother and sister
again and never knew what became of them.
Uncle Charlie said Mr. Harris was a pretty rough master, and somewhat
close. All rations were weighed out and limited. He had a white
overseer and a negro driver, who was the meanest of all.
Mr. Jason Harris had about sixty slaves, and a large plantation of a
hundred acres, the men and women worked in the fields from six to six,
except on Saturday, when they had half day holiday to clean up
generally.
The home of the Harris family was a large two story house and the
quarters were the regular log cabins with clay chimneys. They cooked in
their cabins, but during the busy season in the fields their dinners
were sent out to them each slave having his own tin pail marked with his
name. Water would be sent out in a barrel mounted on an ox cart.
The old men and women looked after the children of the slaves while
their parents worked in the fields.
When the writer asked Uncle Charlie, if his master or mistress ever
taught him to read or write, he smiled and said:
""No, Madam, only to work"".
When asked if they had any special festivities at Christmas or any other
holiday, he replied:
""No, we had no special jolifications"".
Saturday nights they would sing and dance in the quarters
and have prayer meetings, then on some Sundays, they would hitch
up the mules to a big wagon and all go to the white folks church:
and again there would be camp meetings held and the slaves from
all the surrounding plantations would attend, going to same in
these large wagons, sometimes having four mules to a wagon. They then
would have a jolly time along the way, singing and calling to one
another, and making friends.
Uncle Charlie, said, he drove many a load of cotton in the large mule
wagons from Newton Station to Enterprise, Mississippi.
When asked if that wasn't a chance to run away, he replied:
""Git away, why Madam, those nigger dogs would track you and all you got
was a beating.""
Uncle Charlie seemed to look off in the distance and said: ""You know,
Madam, I never saw a slave rebuked until I came to Mississippi,"" and I
just couldn't understand at first, but he grinned and said: ""Lordy,
Madam, some of those niggers were onery, too, and a nigger driver was a
driver sure enough.""
When the Master's son John Harris went to war, Charlie went with him as
his body guard, and when asked what his duties were, he replied:
""I looked after Marster John, tended the horses and the tents. I recalls
well, Madam, the siege of Vicksburg.""
The writer then asked him if he wasn't afraid of the shot and shell all
around him.
""No, Madam,"" he replied, ""I kept way in the back where the camp was, for
I didn't like to feel the earth trembling 'neath my feet, but you see,
Madam, I loved young Marster John, and he loved me, and I just had to
watch over that boy, and he came through all right.""
Uncle Charlie said when they were told the Yankees were coming through
from their headquarters in Meridian, Mississippi, and warned of their
raids, they all made to the swamps and staid until they had passed on,
but that the Yankees did not disturb the Jason Harris plantation.
After the Surrender Charlie came to Mobile and worked at the Yankee
Camp, living in the quarters located in Holly's Garden. He drove their
wagons and was paid $14.00 a month and his keep. After his discharge he
worked on steamboats and followed different lines of work, being
employed for several years at Mr. M.L. Davis' saw mill, and is at
present living on the Davis place at Oak Grove, Ala., an old Southern
home, with quarters originally built for the employees of the mill and
still known as the ""quarters"", and like other ante-bellum homes they
have their private burying ground on the place.
Uncle Charlie was married four times, but now a widower. He had four
children, two boys who are dead, and two girls, one Carrie Johnson, a
widow, living in Kushla, Ala., and the other, Ella Aarons, a grass
widow, living in Mobile, Ala.
Uncle Charlie says he saw Jeff. Davis as an old man, after the war at
Mississippi City, Miss., and then his face lit up, and he said; ""Wait a
minute, Madam, I saw another president, let me think,â€”Yes, Madam I saw
President Grant. He came through Mobile from New Orleans, and my!
there was a big parade that day.""
When asked about Abraham Lincoln, Uncle Charlie thought awhile, and
answered:
""According to what was issued out in the Bible, there was a time for
slavery, people had to be punished for their sin, and then there was a
time for it not to be, and the Lord had opened a good view to Mr.
Lincoln, and he promoted a good idea.""
When he was asked about Booker T. Washington he replied:
""It was traversed out to him until the white folks took part with him
and helped him carry on.""
Uncle Charlie thinks the present day folks are bad and wicked, and dont
realize anything like the old folks.
Charlie is a Baptist, became one when he sought the Lord and thinks all
people should be religious.","Personal contact with Uncle Charlie Aarons

Despite the challenges, Charlie found moments of joy in singing, dancing, and prayer meetings with his fellow slaves.

After the Civil War, Charlie worked at a Yankee camp in Mobile before finding employment on steamboats and at a sawmill in Oak Grove, Alabama. He married four times and had four children, though only two daughters, Carrie Johnson and Ella Aarons, survived.

Anthony Abercrombie,OLD JOE CAN KEEP HIS TWO BITS,"Anthony Abercrombie
Interview with Anthony Abercrombie
â€”
Susie R. O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama
Uncle Ant'ny sat dozing in the early morning sunshine on his rickety
front porch. He is a thin little old man with patches of white wool here
and there on his bald head, and an expression of kindness and gentleness
on his wrinkled old face.
As I went cautiously up the steps, which appeared none too safe, his
cane which had been leaning against his chair, fell to the floor with a
clatter. He awoke with a start and began fumbling around for it with his
trembling and bony hands.
""Uncle Ant'ny, you don't see so well, do you?"" I asked as I recovered
the stick for him. ""No ma'am, I sho' don't,"" he replied. ""I ain't seed
none outen one of my eyes in near 'bout sixty years, and de doctor say I
got a catalac on de yuther one; but I knows you is white folks. I always
is been puny, but I reckon I does purty well considerin' I is a hundred
years old.""
""How do you know you are that old?"" I inquired of him. Without
hesitation he answered, ""I knows I's dat old 'cause my mistis put it
down in de Bible. I was born on de fourth day and I was a full growed
man when de war come on in '61.
""Yassum, my mind kinder comes and goes, but I can always 'member 'bout
slave'y time. Hits de things what happen in dese days dat's so easy for
me to disremember. I b'longed to Marster Jim Abercrombie. His plantation
was 'bout sixteen miles north of Marion in Bibb county. When his son,
young Jim, ma'ied, old Marse Jim give me to him and he fetched me to
Perry county.
""No'm, old marster didn't go to war 'ca'se he was corrupted; he was
deaf in bofe ears and couldn't see good nuther. But he didn't care much
'bout me 'caze I was puny like and warn't much 'count in de field.
""My mistis, Miss Lou, was raisin' me up to be a carriage driver, an' she
was jes' as good to me as she could be. She useta dose me up wid castor
oil, jimson root, and dogwood tea when I'd be feelin' po'ly, and she'd
always take up for me when Marse Jim get in behind me 'bout somep'n. I
reckon though I was a purty worrisome nigger in dem days; always gettin'
in some kind of mischief.
""O yassum, I useta go to meetin'. Us niggers didn't have no meetin'
house on de plantation, but Marse Jim 'lowed us to build a brush arbor.
Den two years atter de surrender I took consideration and j'ined up wid
de Lawd. Dat's how come I live so long. De Lawd done told me, 'Antn'y,
you got a hundred and twenty miles to trabel. Dat mean you gwine to live
a hundred and twenty years, if you stay on de straight an' narrow road.
But if you don't, you gotter go jes' de same as all de yuthers.'""
""Tell me something about your master's slaves and his overseers,"" I
asked of him.
""Well,"" he said, ""Marse Jim had 'bout three hundred slaves, and he hed
one mighty bad overseer. But he got killed down on de bank of de creek
one night. Dey never did find out who killed him, but Marse Jim always
b'lieved de field han's done it. 'Fore dat us niggers useta go down to
de creek to wash ourselves, but atter de overseer got killed down
dar, us jes' leave off dat washin', 'cause some of 'em seed de
overseer's ha'nt down dar floatin' over de creek.
""Dar was another ha'nt on de plantation, too. Marse Jim had some trouble
wid a big double-j'inted nigger named Joe. One day he turn on Marse Jim
wid a fence rail, and Marse Jim had to pull his gun an' kill him. Well,
dat happen in a skirt of woods what I get my lightwood what I use to
start a fire. One day I went to dem same woods to get some 'simmons.
Another nigger went wid me, and he clumb de tree to shake de 'simmons
down whilst I be pickin' 'em up. 'Fore long I heared another tree
shakin' every time us shake our tree, dat other tree shake too, and down
came de 'simmons from it. I say to myself, 'Dat's Joe, 'cause he likes
'simmons too.' Den I grab up my basket and holler to de boy in de tree,
'nigger turn loose and drap down from dar, and ketch up wid me if you
can. I's leavin' here right now, 'cause Old Joe is over dar gettin'
'simmons too.'
""Den another time I was in de woods choppin' lightwood. It was 'bout
sundown, and every time my ax go 'whack' on de lightwood knot, I hear
another whack 'sides mine. I stops and lis'ens and don't hear nothin'.
Den I starts choppin' ag'in I hears de yuther whacks. By dat time my
houn' dog was crouchin' at my feets, wid de hair standin' up on his back
and I couldn't make him git up nor budge.
""Dis time I didn' stop for nothin'. I jes' drap my ax right dar, an' me
and dat houn' dog tore out for home lickety split. When us got dar Marse
Jim was settin' on de porch, an' he say: 'Nigger, you been up to somep'n
you got no business. You is all outen breath. Who you runnin' from?' Den
I say: 'Marse Jim, somebody 'sides me is choppin' in yo' woods, an' I
can't see him. And Marse Jim, he say: 'Ah, dat ain't nobody but Ole Joe.
Did he owe you anythin'?' An' I say: 'Yassah, he owe me two-bits for
helpin' him shuck corn.' 'Well,' Marse Jim say, 'don't pay him no mind:
it jes' Old Joe come back to pay you.'
""Anyhow, I didn' go back to dem woods no mo'. Old Joe can jes' have de
two-bits what he owe me, 'cause I don't want him follerin' 'roun' atter
me. When he do I can't keep my mind on my business.""","Interview with Anthony Abercrombie

Molly Ammond Ammonds,JESUS HAS MY CHILLUN COUNTED,"Molly Ammond (Ammonds)
Interview with Molly Ammond (Ammonds)
â€”
Gertha Couric
I walked along a dusty road under the blazing sun. In the shade of a
willow tree a Negro man was seated with his legs drawn up and his arms
crossed upon his knees. His head rested face downward upon his arms, as
he had the aspect of one in deep slumber. Beside him munching on a few
straggly weeds, a cantankerous mule took little notice of his
surroundings.
""Can you tell me where Aunt Molly Ammonds lives?"" I asked in a loud
voice. The Negro stirred slowly, finally raising his head, and
displaying three rabbit teeth, he accompanied his answer with a slight
gesture of his hand.
""Yassuh, dar her house raght across de road; de house wid de climbin'
roses on hit.""
""Thank you,"" I said.
""Yassuh,"" was the drawled response, and the Negro quickly resumed his
former posture.
Aunt Molly Ammonds is as gentle as a little child. Her voice is soft and
each phrase measured to the slow functionings of her aged mind.
Molly Ammond (Ammonds), Eufaula, Alabama
""Honey,"" she said, ""you ain't gwineter believe dis, but I is de mammy of
thirty chilluns. Jesus got 'em counted an' so is me. I was born in a log
cabin dat had a loft, an' it was on Marse Lee Cato's plantation five
miles wes' of Eufaula. My pappy's name was Tobe Cato an' my mammy's was
Sophia. I had one sister, Marthy, an' two brothers, Bong and Toge. My
pappy made all de furniture dat went in our house an' it were might'
good furniture too. Us useta cook on de fiahplace. Us would cook ash
cakes. Dey was made outen meal, water and a little pinch of lard; on
Sundays dey was made outen flour, buttermilk an' lard. Mammy would rake
all de ashes out de fiahplace, den kivver de cake wid de hot ashes an'
let it cool till it was done.
""Yas Missy,"" she continued, ""I recollects dat I was 'bout twelve or
fo'teen when de s'render come, kaze a little atter dat I ma'ied Pastor
Ammonds. We walked ober to Georgetown an' it was de fus' time I eber had
shoes, and I got dem fum ole Massa. I remembers dat I ma'ied in a
striped calico dress.""
""Aunt Molly,"" I said, ""you're getting a little ahead of your story, tell
me something about your plantation life before the war.""
""Well, honey, Massa Lee's place was 'bout three miles long an' two miles
wide, and we raised cotton, cawn, 'taters and all sorts of vegetables.
We had a mean oberseer dat always wanted to whup us, but massa wouldn't
'llow no whuppin'. Sometimes de massa whould ride over de place on a
hoss, an' when he come up on de oberseer a-fussin' at a nigger, Massa
say, 'Don't talk rough to dat nigger when he doin' de bes' he can.'
""My pappy had a little garden of his own back of his cabin, an' he
raised some chickens for us to eat, an' we had aigs nearly ev'y mornin'.
""De only work I done on de plantation was to nuss some little niggers
when dere mammy an' pappy was in de fiel's. Twarn't hard.
""Nawsuh! I ain't never seed no slave in chains. Massa Lee was a good
man. He had a church built called de brush house, dat had a flo' and
some seats, an' a top made outen pine boughs, an' massa's pa, Mr. Cato,
would preach eve'y Sunday. We sung songs lak 'I Heered De Voice of Jesus
Say,' an' 'I'se Gwine to Die no Mo.' We was all babtized in de creek,
but none of us was taught to read or write.
""No-suh, I ain't never seed no slave run away. Us was treated fine. Our
folks was quality. We had plenty som'n t'eat, but dem slaves hadda work
powerful hard though. Atter dey come home fum de fiel's dey was so
tired dat dey go raght to sleep, except when de massa had barbecues.
Christmas was de big time; dere was several days to res' an' make
merryin' an' lots of dem no count niggers got drunk.
""When us slaves was sick, Massa Lee would send to Eufaula to fetch Dr.
Thornton to give us some medicine. We had de bes' treatment ever.
""Yassuh, white folks, dem days is long ago. All my chilluns done died or
wandered away an' my ole man been dead goin' on twenty years. I been
here a long time by myself.""
""Aunt Molly,"" I interrupted. ""There's one thing I've always been wanting
to ask one of you ex-slaves, and that is: what you thought of people
like Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis and Booker T. Washington.""
A puzzled expression came of the face of the old Negro. ""White folks,""

pleasure of meetin' dem gent'mens.""","Interview with Molly Ammond (Ammonds)

lie on de moss an' let my bare belly git cool an' put my face in de
outlet of de spring an' let de water trickle over my haid. Jus' about de
time I gits a little rest one of dem niggers would call: 'Water boy!
Bring dat bucket!' Den I grab up de bucket an' run back out in de hot
sun.
""One day, on my las' trip, I was mighty tired an' I flop down on dat
moss wid de sweat a-drippin' from my body, an' 'fo' I knowed it I done
fell slap to sleep. When I woke up, it was almos' dark, an' I couldn't
hear de slaves a-singing' in de fiel's, so I knowed dat dey had gone
home. I shake my haid, an' look about me, an' my eyes came to res' on a
little black bear cub a-drinkin' outen de spring. He so was a cute
little boogar an' I made up my mind right den to try an' kotch him. I
was jus' a little nigger 'bout ten year old an' didn't have no sense,
but I sho' wanted dat little bear. He ain't seed me a-settin' dere, so
I snuck up real cautious like, an' afore he knowed it I had dat little
debil a-squealin' in my han's. I was jus' about to start home wid him,
when I hears a rustlin' in de bushes an' afore I went ten feets, here
come a big, black bear a-lopin' along right outen dem willow trees. I
drop dat little critter 'caze I knowed dat was his mammy an' she was
ravin' mad. When I let de little feller fall it must have hurt him
somp'n awful caze he howl mo' dan eber, an' went a limpin' up to his
mammy. Well, suh, dat ole woman she got so mad she made fo' me lak two
bolts of lightnin', but dese here feets of mine begin a-doin' dere
stuff. I knowed she was a-gainin' on me so I lets out a whoop for help.
She chased me 'cross dat empty field an' 'bout dat time I seen big Jim
a-comin' through a row of cawn. 'Hurry Big Jim,' I calls, 'a bear is
atter me!' Big Jim was de biggest nigger on our place. He must have
weighed as much as half a bale of cotton. I was jus' 'bout gittin' to de
aidge of de cawn when dat bear ketched me. He give me a slap wid his paw
an' I goes down wid my mouf a-scoopin' up de dus'. My back felt like
somebody done put a hot iron on it. Dat bear was a mean one. I was
expectin' her to chaw me up an' I drawed my body up in a knot and
kivered my haid wid my hands an' waited. But dat bear neber touch me
agin'. I kinda snuck my eye aroun' an' I saw big Jim havin' it out wid
her. Jim, he had a long knife an' dey was a-tumblin' an' a-rollin' in de
dust, while I sot dere wid my eyes a-poppin' outen my haid an' my back
feelin' like it was broke. Jim he wrap his legs roun' dat bear an' 'fore
you knowed it he had done stuck dat ole critter a dozen times wid dat
knife.
""About fifteen minutes later me an' Jim was a-walkin' back through de
cawn fiel' an' I guess we looked a sight, 'caze I was all tore up an'
Jim he looked like he done mess up wid a fambly of wildcats. He was
bleedin' from haid to foot. When we walked into de big house to git some
treatments an' medicine for our hurts, Mistis was a-standin' dere, and
when she seed me an' Jim, she almost faint. She say: 'Whut done happen
to my niggers?'
""Atter me an' Jim got fixed up I was jus' as happy, kaze I done seed de
bes' fight dere eber was, an' I had me a little orphan bear cub.""","Interview with Tom Baker

Susie R. O'Brien",[],,,,,"Tom Baker was born in the rural South in the late 1800s, where he worked as a water boy for fifty field hands. His job consisted of carrying buckets of water from a spring located one field over from where the workers toiled in the sun all day. Despite the grueling nature of his work, Tom found solace in the cool shade of the willow trees by the spring, where he would rest and cool off before his next trip.

One day, while taking a break by the spring, Tom encountered a bear cub drinking from the water. Enamored by the cute creature, he attempted to capture it, unaware that the cub's mother was nearby. The mother bear soon appeared, sending Tom into a frenzied sprint for safety. With the help of a fellow worker, Big Jim, Tom narrowly escaped the angry bear's clutches, but not without sustaining injuries from the encounter.

After a harrowing battle with the bear, Tom and Big Jim returned to the plantation with injuries that left their mistress shocked. Despite the dangerous encounter, Tom couldn't help but feel a sense of thrill and excitement at having witnessed and survived such an extraordinary event. The memory of the bear encounter would stay with Tom for the rest of his life, a testament to his resilience and bravery in the face of danger."

Gertha Couric, Eufaula, Alabama
I walked up a little path bordered with small stones, an atmosphere of
solitude surrounding me. In the sky, large, white cumulous clouds like
great bolls of cotton, floated leisurely northward. Far down the road a
ramshackle buckboard disappeared over a slight hill; directly in front
the path ran at twenty yards into the dilapidated steps of a Negro
cabin, while an old colored man in a vegetable garden to the left to the
cabin broke the stillness with the intermittent metallic sounds of his
spade digging into thirsty soil. I knew at a glance that this was Nathan
Beauchamp.
""Hello, Uncle Nathan,"" I called.
Nathan Beauchamp, Eufaula, Alabama
""Mornin', white folks,"" he answered, as he discontinued his spading and
raised his hand in a friendly gesture.
I walked over to where Uncle Nathan was standing and stopped in the
little furrows of brown earth. Already a thick coat of dust had formed
on my shoes.
""Uncle Nathan,"" I said, ""I'd like to have a brief chat with you about
slavery days, if you can spare a few minutes from your garden here?""
""Yassuh, boss,"" he said, punctuating his reply with a spat of tobacco
that was soon nothing but a dark mark in the parched ground, ""glad to be
of any 'sistance.""
We moved to the shade of a large oak where we sat down together on a
sturdy, home-made bench.
""Well, white folks,"" he went on after taking a long turn at the dipper
hanging on the tree which shades a well. ""I'll tell you a story of my
mammy an' pappy. Nathan Beauchamp, my pappy, belonged to Massa Green
Beauchamp at White Oak Springs, near Eufaula.
Massa Green was a member of de legislature when de capital was at
Tuscaloosy. He had many a acre of land an' hund'eds of slaves. Pappy use
to dribe de wagon in to Eufaula to git supplies an' on de way he would
meet up wid an Injun gal a-carryin' big baskets dat she was a goin' to
sell dere. He would ask her iffen she wanted to ride, an' she always say
yes. So one day pappy came to de massa and tell him dat dere was an
Injun gal on de St. Francis Indian Village dat he wanted fo' a wife, an'
de boss say all right so pappy married de Indian gal. Her name was Mimi.
So I is half nigger an half Injun. My mammy died 'bout five year after
freedom, but I can remembers dat she had long black hair, and I
remembers de way de sun sparkle on her teeth when she smile. Atter she
married pappy, she still carried her pretty baskets to Eufaula to sell.
Sometime she walk all de way dere and back, twenty fo' miles. I been
libin' here in Eufaula fifty year or mo', white fo'ks, an' I owns my

Oliver Bell says the first thing he remembers was seeing his mother
whipped. He was born in slavery, but most of his knowledge of the evils,
as well as the joys of ante-bellum days, is by hearsay only.
""I was borned on de De Graffenreid Place,"" he said, ""nine miles west of
Livingston-Boyd Road. My mother was Luella De Graffenreid an' my pappy
was Edmund De Graffenreid. Den dey changed my name to Bell. I had one
brother, Nat, an' two sisters, Jestina an' Clara. I has 'bout sixteen
chilluns, all born on de same place an' most of dem is livin' dere yit.
My chillun by my firs' wife are Ed, Jack, Holly, Buck, Clarence, Sally,
Liza, Mag an' Luella. Dey ma was Mandy Powell, frum York. Den my second
wife, Bettie Brown, gived me de res' of my chilluns. Le's see, dey is

explained, ""Dat's as many as I kin' 'member jest now.

""My gran'ma's name was Cely De Graffenreid an' my gran'pa's name
was Peter. He was a shoemaker fur de place an' made plows, too. He was
a worker an' he learnt me how to pull fodder an' chop corn an' cotton
when I was jest a little scamp jes' a little black nigger.
""Us all b'longed to Mr. Tresvan De Graffenreid an' Mistus Rebecca;
an' dey was all good to us. Ol' Mistus read de Bible to us an' got us
baptized in de river at Horn's bridge, but dat was atter de surrender. In
slavery times dey didn't like for us to sing an play loud in de quarters.
Honey, I 'members when us had de big prayer meetin's. Dey would shut de
door so de voice won't git out, an' dey would turn de washpot down de door.
Dat was to keep de voice inside, dey tol' me.""
Oliver mused a moment, recalling the old times.
""Us chilluns useta have a good time singin' an' a-playin',"" he
said. ""I 'members one of our little verses run somethin' lak dis:
Shoo, shoo, shoo gander
Th'ow yo' feathers 'way yander.
""Us had ol' corn hollers, too, but I fergits um now. I does remember
though you could hear dem niggers holler a whole mile.
""No'm, it warn't so bad wid us. De white folks was good to us niggers.
Us had 'nough to eat, lak greens, frum de big house. Us had our rations
weighted out; peck o' meal, three pounds of meat, half gallon of
'lasses, made at home in wodden mills; an' dat was for a week. An'
sometimes, on a Sunday us had a little sugar, coffee an' flour. No'm, us
didn't know what rice was.
""What I seed of slavery was a bad idea, I reckon, but ev'ybody thought
dey marster was de bes' in de lan'. Us didn't know no better. A man was
growed plum' green 'fo he knew de whole worl' didn't belong to his ol'
marster.
""Us didn't have no bought medicine in dem days; jes' whut us got outta
de woods lak slippery ellum fer fever an' poke salad root; dey he'p a
lot. An' May-apple root would he'p you same as castor oil.
""Didn't nobody he'p us learn nothin' much, but mos' of my chilluns went
to Booker T's school. Dey say he's a mighty smart man, an' my chilluns
thinks so, too. It's all right; I wish I could read an' write; den I'd
tell you things you'd lak to know.""
His face clouded for the briefest moment.
""I tell you de fust thing I 'members, an' I don't know whut started it.
One day my mammy done sumpin' an' ol' marster made her pull her dress
down 'roun' her waist an' made her lay down 'crost de door. Den he taken
a leather strop an' whooped her. I 'members dat I started cryin' an'
Mistus Beckie said, 'Go git dat boy a biskit.'
""I reckerlecks my mammy was a plow han' an' she'd go to work soon an'
put me under de shade of a big ol' post-oak tree. Dere I sat all day,
an' dat tree was my nurse. It still standin' dere yit, an' I won't let
nobody cut it down.
""Mammy say I never did learn to walk; jes' one day she sot me down under
de oak, an' fust thing she knowed she look up an' dere I was walkin'
down de middle of a cotton row.
""'Nother thing I 'members when I was a little boy; dat dey was 'vidin'
de corn atter de s'render. Dr. DeGraffenreid measured de corn out to all
of 'em whut was share han's. He'd take a bushel an' give 'em a bushel.
When he mos' through he'd throw a ear of corn to dis one, an' give
himse'f a ear; den he break a ear in two, an' he take part an' give dem
part. Dat was close measurin', I tell you.
""Us lived in de third house frum de big house in de quarter, an' when I
was a boy it was my job to set out shade trees. An' one day de Ku Klux
come ridin' by an' dey leader was Mister Steve Renfroe. (Alabama bandit
of Reconstruction days). He wore long hair an' he call my pappy out an'
ax him a heap of questions. While he sittin' dere his horse pull up nigh
'bout all de trees I done sot out.
""Atter talkin' to my pappy, he rode on 'cross Horn's bridge, 'bout two
miles souf of here, an' dere he met Ol' Man Enoch Sledge an' Frank
Sledge. Dey was darkies whut b'longed to Marsa Simmy Sledge's father,
Ol' Doctor Sledge. Slaves on dat plantation was 'lowed pretty good
privilege atter de s'rrender an' was workin' on halvens. Uncle Enoch an'
Frank was in town tradin' some, an' Mr. Renfroe didn't want 'em to have
anything. When dey lef' town, dey pass de Ku Kluxes raght on de slough
bridge. Mister Renfroe ax Enoch to give him a piece of string to fix his
saddle wid; den shot him. Frank run to de river, but de Ku Kluxes
cotched him an' shot him, too.
""De niggers went down to de river dat night an' got de bodies an' buried
'em in de ol' Travis graveyard. My mammy an' daddy is buried dere, too.
""Didn' nobody do nothin' 'bout Mister Renfroe 'till he went on an' got
to messin' wid Marsa Simmy Sledge's things; stole a pair of mules an' de
white folks rambled atter him 'till dey foun' him in Linden. Dey got so
hot atter him dat he went to his camp in de flat woods down on Bear
Creek. Dem was skeery times, 'case dat man never had no mercy for
nobody.
""Dey's a cave down by de burial grounds whut de slaves dug when dey run
away, an' Mister Renfroe stayed dere. It's on de river bank an' its dug
up. You digs an' starts low an' pushes de dirt out an' digs up an' makes
a big room up so de water won't git you. I knows whar dey's two of de
caves on de place; my cow fell in one yestidy.
""When Ol' Marster Amos Travis come out here from Californy, he taken a
lakin' to me an' wanted me to leave t'other side of de place an' move
down dis side of de big house to take keer of dis swamp an' look atter
de han's. But I wanted a big house wid four rooms an' two brick
chimneys, an' I had to talk five years to git it. I's got some
rosebushes now dat was at de big house raght atter de s'rrender, an'
dey's growin' in my yard now.
""Speakin' 'bout graveyard, I was passin' dere one night, ridin' on 'bout
midnight, an' sumpin' come draggin' a chain by me lak a dog. I got down
off'n my horse, but couldn't see nothin' wid no chain, so I got back on
de horse an' dere raght in front of me was a Jack-Me-Lantern wid de
brightes' light you ever seed. It was tryin' to lead me off, an' ev'y
time I'd git back in de road it would lead me off ag'in. You sho' will
git los' if you follow a Jack-Me-Lantern.
""One of dem led a man down to de creek by dem double bridges; said he
foun' he was travelin' in de wrong direction, gittin' frum home stidder
clo'ster, so he jes' sit down under a tree an' waited 'til daylight. I
ain't skeered of nothin' but dem Jack-Me-Lanterns, but dey stirs you up
in yo' min' till you can't tell whar you's at; an' dey's so bright dey
nigh 'bout puts yo' eyes out. Dey is plenty of 'em over by de graveyard
raght over yonder whar all my white folks is buried, an' mammy an'
pappy, too. Dey's all dere 'cept Marsa Jess Travis; he was de nex' whut
come in line for de place, an' he was de bes' frein' dis here nigger
ever had.
""Fac' was, dat's whut he call me; 't was 'nigger'. He an' Mistus Mag
lived raght dere in de big house; den dey move into town an' dat's whar
he died. Me an' Marsa Jess made a 'greement an' he said if he was de
longes' liver, he'd see me buried, an' if I be de longes' liver, I see
him buried. So dat day I went to his office in de co'thouse an' he say
he want to talk wid me. He say, 'You 'members us 'greement?' An' I say,
'Whut 'greement, Marsa Jess?' An' he say, 'Bout buryin'.' Den I say,
sho', 'I 'members dat.'
""Den he got up an' give me some papers 'bout some lan', an' I say, 'Whut
do all dis here mean, Marse Jess?' He say, 'nothin', nigger, 'cept I's
jes' goin' outta business.' Den I say, 'Goodbye, Marse Jess,' an' he
say, 'Goodbye, nigger,' an' I walked on 'crost de street. Den Mr.
Killian say, 'Oliver, whut's happened over at de co'thouse?' An I say,
'Ain't nothin' as I knows of.' Den he say, 'Yes, dey is; jes' look at de
peoples gwine in a hurry.' Den I turn 'roun' an' run back an' dere lay

Ruby Pickens Tartt, Livingston",['images/image033bell.jpg'],"Oliver Bell, Livingston, Alabama","Livingston, Alabama",Sumter,,"Oliver Bell was born in slavery on the De Graffenreid Place, located nine miles west of Livingston-Boyd Road in Livingston, Alabama. He was the son of Luella and Edmund De Graffenreid, and had one brother, Nat, and two sisters, Jestina and Clara. Bell had a total of sixteen children, with his first wife Mandy Powell and second wife Bettie Brown. Most of his children attended Booker T's school, and Bell expressed a desire to read and write so he could share more about his experiences.

Bell's family had a close relationship with the De Graffenreids, who treated their slaves well and provided them with sufficient food and supplies. He recalled moments from his childhood, such as setting out shade trees and encountering the Ku Klux Klan. Bell also shared stories about supernatural occurrences, including encounters with Jack-Me-Lanterns and the mystery surrounding a cave on the plantation. He remembered important figures like Marsa Jess Travis and the agreement they made about burying each other when the time came.

One significant event Bell recounted was the tragic death of Marsa Jess Travis by suicide. Travis had a special bond with Bell, referring to him affectionately as ""nigger,"" and left him with instructions to always be good to him. Bell fulfilled his promise to Travis by following him to the grave, honoring their agreement. Despite the hardships of slavery and Reconstruction, Bell expressed gratitude for the relationships he had with his family and the white individuals who showed him kindness throughout his life."
