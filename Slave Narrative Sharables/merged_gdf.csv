""Gen'l Grierson and his men marched right through town,"" Gus went on
with his story of his boyhood. ""Mr. Lincoln done said we was free, but
us lil' niggers was too skeered to lissen to any ban' music, even iffen
the so'jers had come to set us free. 'Pears like us was allus gittin' in
somebody's way in dem days and gittin' skeered of somepin'. But we went
on away from the so'jers and had a good time 'mongst ourselves like we
always done when there wasn't any cotton pickin'. Cotton pickin' time
was when we didn't have any chance to do any playin'.
""After the surrender I didn't have to do any more cotton pickin' and I
went blacksmithin' for Joe Sturgis. He was the first blacksmith in dis
here town. I was the second. Now my son done took on de work. They ain't
so much sence all dese here automobiles done got so plentiful and might
'nigh ruint de business. But for seventy years I riz wid de sun and went
to dat blacksmith shop. I's enjoying a little misery now; so I's takin'
my rest.""
Gus Askew, Eufaula, Alabama
Gus Askew was born a slave of the Edwards family in Henry County in
1853. He was brought to Eufaula just before the close of the war and
stayed on as a blacksmith after he was freed. In his seventy years of
hard work he saved enough to buy his home and some property which
maintains him and his wife since age and infirmity forced him to turn
over the work to his son. He has been married 54 years, numbers his
white friends by the hundreds and is held in great respect by his own
race.","Interview with Gus Askew

""Gen'l Grierson and his men marched right through town,"" Gus went on
with his story of his boyhood. ""Mr. Lincoln done said we was free, but
us lil' niggers was too skeered to lissen to any ban' music, even iffen
the so'jers had come to set us free. 'Pears like us was allus gittin' in
somebody's way in dem days and gittin' skeered of somepin'. But we went
on away from the so'jers and had a good time 'mongst ourselves like we
always done when there wasn't any cotton pickin'. Cotton pickin' time
was when we didn't have any chance to do any playin'.
""After the surrender I didn't have to do any more cotton pickin' and I
went blacksmithin' for Joe Sturgis. He was the first blacksmith in dis
here town. I was the second. Now my son done took on de work. They ain't
so much sence all dese here automobiles done got so plentiful and might
'nigh ruint de business. But for seventy years I riz wid de sun and went
to dat blacksmith shop. I's enjoying a little misery now; so I's takin'
my rest.""
Gus Askew, Eufaula, Alabama
Gus Askew was born a slave of the Edwards family in Henry County in
1853. He was brought to Eufaula just before the close of the war and
stayed on as a blacksmith after he was freed. In his seventy years of
hard work he saved enough to buy his home and some property which
maintains him and his wife since age and infirmity forced him to turn
over the work to his son. He has been married 54 years, numbers his
white friends by the hundreds and is held in great respect by his own
race.","Interview with Gus Askew

Interview with Nathan Beauchamp

Gertha Couric, Eufaula, Alabama
I walked up a little path bordered with small stones, an atmosphere of
solitude surrounding me. In the sky, large, white cumulous clouds like
great bolls of cotton, floated leisurely northward. Far down the road a
ramshackle buckboard disappeared over a slight hill; directly in front
the path ran at twenty yards into the dilapidated steps of a Negro
cabin, while an old colored man in a vegetable garden to the left to the
cabin broke the stillness with the intermittent metallic sounds of his
spade digging into thirsty soil. I knew at a glance that this was Nathan
Beauchamp.
""Hello, Uncle Nathan,"" I called.
Nathan Beauchamp, Eufaula, Alabama
""Mornin', white folks,"" he answered, as he discontinued his spading and
raised his hand in a friendly gesture.
I walked over to where Uncle Nathan was standing and stopped in the
little furrows of brown earth. Already a thick coat of dust had formed
on my shoes.
""Uncle Nathan,"" I said, ""I'd like to have a brief chat with you about
slavery days, if you can spare a few minutes from your garden here?""
""Yassuh, boss,"" he said, punctuating his reply with a spat of tobacco
that was soon nothing but a dark mark in the parched ground, ""glad to be
of any 'sistance.""
We moved to the shade of a large oak where we sat down together on a
sturdy, home-made bench.
""Well, white folks,"" he went on after taking a long turn at the dipper
hanging on the tree which shades a well. ""I'll tell you a story of my
mammy an' pappy. Nathan Beauchamp, my pappy, belonged to Massa Green
Beauchamp at White Oak Springs, near Eufaula.
Massa Green was a member of de legislature when de capital was at
Tuscaloosy. He had many a acre of land an' hund'eds of slaves. Pappy use
to dribe de wagon in to Eufaula to git supplies an' on de way he would
meet up wid an Injun gal a-carryin' big baskets dat she was a goin' to
sell dere. He would ask her iffen she wanted to ride, an' she always say
yes. So one day pappy came to de massa and tell him dat dere was an
Injun gal on de St. Francis Indian Village dat he wanted fo' a wife, an'
de boss say all right so pappy married de Indian gal. Her name was Mimi.
So I is half nigger an half Injun. My mammy died 'bout five year after
freedom, but I can remembers dat she had long black hair, and I
remembers de way de sun sparkle on her teeth when she smile. Atter she
married pappy, she still carried her pretty baskets to Eufaula to sell.
Sometime she walk all de way dere and back, twenty fo' miles. I been
libin' here in Eufaula fifty year or mo', white fo'ks, an' I owns my
little cabin an' de lan' around it. T'ain't much, but its enough to keep
me a-goin', dis wid de little sto' I owns.""","Interview with Nathan Beauchamp

Interview with Lizzie Hill

Aunt Lizzie Hill, 94 years of age, moved from the Spurlock plantation,
four miles out, to the city of Eufaula about 20 years ago. She was of
such vigorous constitution, that until recently, she carried on her
regular occupation of laundress or ""wash-'oman,"" as she calls herself.
Too feeble to work regularly, she now is cared for by a niece with whom
she lives.
Sitting before the fire in a rocking-chair, smoking a clay pipe-her
neat clothing, snow-white hair and wrinkled, kindly face make a pleasing
picture of contentment. Her mind is, apparently, unimpaired, and she
readily responds to her recollections of slavery:
Lizzie Hill, Eufaula, Alabama
""Sho, Missey, I 'members 'bout it! I was most grown when freedom come.
My Marster (Richard Dozier) and my Mistis was good to all dey niggers
and dey raised me right. I had two little mistises 'bout as old as me,
and I played wid dem all de time and slep' on a pallet in dey room ev'y
night. Dey slep' on de big bed. My clothes was jes' as good and clean as
deyrn, an I et what dey et.""
The little girls, she explained, were about six and eight years old when
this association began, and it continued until close of the war, when
all were nearly grown.
""Atter freedom come,"" continued Aunt Lizzie, ""Mammy moved to Cuthbert
and tuk me erway fum Old Mistis; but I runned away and went back to
Mistis, and walked all de fourteen miles down de big road at night-I
runned most ob de way. Three times I done dat, but Mammy come and tuk me
back to work in de field ev'y time. I wanted to stay wid Old Mistis. Dey
called her 'Miss Everline' and ev'ybody liked her. Bofe my little
mistises got mai'ed and den Old Marster and Old Mistis moved off to
Texas, and I ain't eber seed none ob 'em no more. I's had a hard time
workin' in de field since de war. Fo' freedom come, I nebber worked
cep'n in de house-I was a 'house-girl' and didn't do no field
work.""","Interview with Lizzie Hill

can tell you, dough,"" she went on, ""kaze I was only twelve years old
when de war ended.
""I was bawn on Marse Bennett's plantation near Louisville, Alabama. Ma
Mammy's name was Hester an' my pappy was named Sam.
""I remembers one night raght atter de war when de re'struction was
a-goin' on. Dere was some niggers not far fum our place dat said dey was
agoin' to take some lan' dat warn't deres. Dere massa had been kilt in
de war an' warn't nobody 'ceptin' de mistis an' some chilluns. Well,
Honey, dem niggers, mo' dan one hundred of 'em, commenced a riot an' was
a-takin' things dat don't belong to 'em. Dat night de white lady she
come ober to our place wid a wild look on her face. She tell Massa
Bennett, whut dem niggers is up to, an' widout sayin' a word, Massa
Bennett putt his hat on an lef' out de do'. Twarn't long atter dat when
some hosses was heered down de road, an' I look out my cabin window
which was raght by de road, an' I saw acomin' up through de trees a
whole pack of ghosties; I thought dey was, anyways. Dey was all dressed
in white, an' dere hosses was white an' dey galloped faster dan de win'
raght past my cabin. Den I heered a nigger say: 'De Ku Klux is atter
somebody.'
""Dem Ku Klux went ober to dat lady's plantation an' told dem niggers dat
iffen dey ever heered of 'em startin' anything mo' dat dey was a-goin'
to tie 'em all to trees in de fores' till dey all died f'um being
hongry. Atter dat dese niggers all 'roun' Louisville, dey kept mighty
quiet.
""No m'am, I don't believe in no conjurin'. Dese conjure women say dat
dey will make my hip well iffen I gives 'em half my rations I gits fum
de gover'ment, but I knows dey ain't nothin' but low-down, no-count
niggers.""
""Speaking of the Ku Klux, Aunt Hannah. Were you afraid of them?""
""Naw'm, I warn't afeered of no Ku Klux. At fu'st I though dat dey was
ghosties and den I was afeered of 'em, but atter I found out dat Massa
Bennett was one of dem things, I was always proud of 'em.""

""Well, what about the Yankees?"" she was asked. ""Did you ever see any
Yankees; and what did you think of the ones that came through your
place? Were you glad that they set you free?""
""I suppose dem Yankees was all right in dere place,"" she continued, ""but
dey neber belong in de South. Why, Miss, one of 'em axe me what was dem
white flowers in de fiel'? You'd think dat a gent'men wid all dem
decorations on hisself woulda knowed a fiel' of cotton. An' as for dey
a-settin' me free! Miss, us niggers on de Bennett place was free as soon
as we was bawn. I always been free.""","Interview with Hannah Irwin

Interview with Hannah Irwin

Gertha Couric, [HW: Eufaula?]
On a high knoll overlooking the winding Chewalla Creek is a little one
room shack. Its rusty hinges and weather-beaten boards have seen many a
glowing sunset; have stood against many high winds and rains; they have
for many years sheltered Aunt Hannah Irwin, ex-slave. Now the old Negro
woman is too old and feeble to venture very often from her small home.
She lives almost in solitude with her memories of the past, and an
occasional visit from one of her old friends who perhaps brings her some
fruit or a little money.
""Yas'm, I'll be pleased to tell you 'bout whut I remembers aroun' de
time of de War."" Aunt Hannah sat stolidly in a chair that virtually
groaned under her weight; and gave utterance to this sentiment through a
large thick mouth, while her gold ear rings shook with every turn of her
head, and her dim eyes glowed with memory's fires. ""Dere ain't much I
can tell you, dough,"" she went on, ""kaze I was only twelve years old
when de war ended.
""I was bawn on Marse Bennett's plantation near Louisville, Alabama. Ma
Mammy's name was Hester an' my pappy was named Sam.
""I remembers one night raght atter de war when de re'struction was
a-goin' on. Dere was some niggers not far fum our place dat said dey was
agoin' to take some lan' dat warn't deres. Dere massa had been kilt in
de war an' warn't nobody 'ceptin' de mistis an' some chilluns. Well,
Honey, dem niggers, mo' dan one hundred of 'em, commenced a riot an' was
a-takin' things dat don't belong to 'em. Dat night de white lady she
come ober to our place wid a wild look on her face. She tell Massa
Bennett, whut dem niggers is up to, an' widout sayin' a word, Massa
Bennett putt his hat on an lef' out de do'. Twarn't long atter dat when
some hosses was heered down de road, an' I look out my cabin window
which was raght by de road, an' I saw acomin' up through de trees a
whole pack of ghosties; I thought dey was, anyways. Dey was all dressed
in white, an' dere hosses was white an' dey galloped faster dan de win'
raght past my cabin. Den I heered a nigger say: 'De Ku Klux is atter
somebody.'
""Dem Ku Klux went ober to dat lady's plantation an' told dem niggers dat
iffen dey ever heered of 'em startin' anything mo' dat dey was a-goin'
to tie 'em all to trees in de fores' till dey all died f'um being
hongry. Atter dat dese niggers all 'roun' Louisville, dey kept mighty
quiet.
""No m'am, I don't believe in no conjurin'. Dese conjure women say dat
dey will make my hip well iffen I gives 'em half my rations I gits fum
de gover'ment, but I knows dey ain't nothin' but low-down, no-count
niggers.""
""Speaking of the Ku Klux, Aunt Hannah. Were you afraid of them?""
""Naw'm, I warn't afeered of no Ku Klux. At fu'st I though dat dey was
ghosties and den I was afeered of 'em, but atter I found out dat Massa
Bennett was one of dem things, I was always proud of 'em.""
Hannah Irwin, [TR: Eufaula?], Alabama
""Well, what about the Yankees?"" she was asked. ""Did you ever see any
Yankees; and what did you think of the ones that came through your
place? Were you glad that they set you free?""
""I suppose dem Yankees was all right in dere place,"" she continued, ""but
dey neber belong in de South. Why, Miss, one of 'em axe me what was dem
white flowers in de fiel'? You'd think dat a gent'men wid all dem
decorations on hisself woulda knowed a fiel' of cotton. An' as for dey
a-settin' me free! Miss, us niggers on de Bennett place was free as soon
as we was bawn. I always been free.""","Interview with Hannah Irwin

Interview with Mary Rice

Gertha Couric, [HW: Eufaula]
Few of the ex-slaves will readily admit that they were mere field hands
in the old days. Generally they prefer to leave the impression that they
were house servants, or at least stable boys or dairy hands.
But ""aunt"" Mary Rice, age 92, who lives in Eufaula, holds no such view
about the superior social position of house servants. She was a ""big
missy gal"" ('teen age) during the War, and about her duties on the
plantation of Dr. Cullen Battle near Tuskegee, where she was born, she
said:
""Honey, I lived in de quahter. I was a fiel' nigger, but when I was a
lil' gal, I helped around de milk-house, churnin', washing de pails and
de lak, and den give all de little niggers milk.
Mary Rice, Eufaula, Alabama
""Massa Cullen and Mistis' Ma'y Jane was de bes' Marster and Mistis' in
de worl'. Once when I was awful sick, Mistis' Ma'y Jane had me brung in
de Big House and put me in a room dat sot on de 'tother side of the
kitchen so she could take kere of me herself 'cause it was a right fur
piece to de quahter and I had to be nussed day and night.
""Yassum, I was jes' as happy bein' a fiel' han' as I would'er been at de
Big House; mebbe mo' so. De fiel' han's had a long spell when de crops
was laid by in de summer and dat's when Massa Cullen 'lowed us to
'jubilate' (several days of idle celebration). I was happy all de time
in slavery days, but dere ain't much to git happy over now, 'cep'n I's
livin'-thank de Lawd. Massa Cullen was a rich man, and owned all de
worl' from Chestnut Hill to de ribers, and us always had eberything us
needed.
""Niggers dese days ain't neber knowed whut good times is. Mebbe dat's
why dey ain't no 'count. And dey is so uppity, too, callin' dereselves
'cullud folks and havin' gold teeth. Dey sez de mo' gold teeth dey has,
de higher up in chu'ch dey sets. Huh!""","Interview with Mary Rice

Interview with Mary Rice

Gertha Couric, [HW: Eufaula]
Few of the ex-slaves will readily admit that they were mere field hands
in the old days. Generally they prefer to leave the impression that they
were house servants, or at least stable boys or dairy hands.
But ""aunt"" Mary Rice, age 92, who lives in Eufaula, holds no such view
about the superior social position of house servants. She was a ""big
missy gal"" ('teen age) during the War, and about her duties on the
plantation of Dr. Cullen Battle near Tuskegee, where she was born, she
said:
""Honey, I lived in de quahter. I was a fiel' nigger, but when I was a
lil' gal, I helped around de milk-house, churnin', washing de pails and
de lak, and den give all de little niggers milk.
Mary Rice, Eufaula, Alabama
""Massa Cullen and Mistis' Ma'y Jane was de bes' Marster and Mistis' in
de worl'. Once when I was awful sick, Mistis' Ma'y Jane had me brung in
de Big House and put me in a room dat sot on de 'tother side of the
kitchen so she could take kere of me herself 'cause it was a right fur
piece to de quahter and I had to be nussed day and night.
""Yassum, I was jes' as happy bein' a fiel' han' as I would'er been at de
Big House; mebbe mo' so. De fiel' han's had a long spell when de crops
was laid by in de summer and dat's when Massa Cullen 'lowed us to
'jubilate' (several days of idle celebration). I was happy all de time
in slavery days, but dere ain't much to git happy over now, 'cep'n I's
livin'-thank de Lawd. Massa Cullen was a rich man, and owned all de
worl' from Chestnut Hill to de ribers, and us always had eberything us
needed.
""Niggers dese days ain't neber knowed whut good times is. Mebbe dat's
why dey ain't no 'count. And dey is so uppity, too, callin' dereselves
'cullud folks and havin' gold teeth. Dey sez de mo' gold teeth dey has,
de higher up in chu'ch dey sets. Huh!""","Interview with Mary Rice

Gertha Couric, [HW: Eufaula]
""Mistus, I hears slavery times is comin' back.""
Uncle Maugan Shepherd is past 80. He idled about the front of his
tumble-down house in Eufaula, happily recalling the old plantation days.
He has never learned to read, and therefore pins a great deal of
dependence upon hearsay.
""Where did you hear about slavery coming back?"" the interviewer asked
him.
""Well, mam, 'pear lak I heard it somewhar. I don't rikolect jest now.""
""Would you like to have the old times back again, Uncle Maugan?""
He studied a moment, beamed:
""Yassum, I would. I'se proud I was borned a slave. I'se too young to
'member much, but I knows I always had enough to eat and wear den, and I
sho don't now.
Uncle Maugan said that he was ""birthed"" at Chestnut Hill; that he
belonged to Marse and Mistus Rich Wiley, and that his father and mother
were Bunk and Betsy Wiley, both ""field niggers."" Maugan had two
brothers, Oliver and Monroe; but no sisters.
""I never seed ma and pa much 'cept on Sundays,"" he explained. ""Dey was
allus workin' in de fields an' I was out chasin' rabbits an' sech mos'
of de time. At night I jest et my cornpone an' drink my buttermilk an'
fell on de bed asleep.""
Maugan remembers one overseer, scornfully referring to him as ""po' white
trash.""
""Us slaves called him by his las' name behin' his back,"" the
old darky explained, ""'caze us hated to 'mister' dat white man.""
Maugan remembers Reconstruction and a great deal about ""atter de
surrender,"" but says ""rickolection ain't so good"" on things that
happened before.
""I 'members dat I was powerful scared of de Yankee soldiers,"" he said,
""but dey never hurt nobody. Dey come through Eufaula an' all us niggers
tried to hide; but dey jest come on by an' laughed at us fer bein'
scared.""
Maugan Shepherd, Eufaula, Alabama
More than fifty years ago, Maugan married Kitty. She is about 70 and
makes her living washing clothes for ""de white peoples."" They never had
any children.
Maugan says he never goes anywhere except to church on Sundays. His legs
are not so strong anymore, he explains.
""My ol' 'oman, she sho' lak to go to funerals,"" he chuckled. ""But in
dese days day takes de body to have it vulcanized, so we can't have no
settin' ups. Dis went hard on Kitty, 'caze she was a mourner; but it
didn't do her no good, shoutin' an' amournin' all night. She would
always come home wid her head tied up an' her eyes set back in her
head.""
Maugan still works. He is a good yardman, but says some day he is just
""gwine ter drap out, lak his pa did.""","Interview with Maugan Shepherd

""'Cose dar wa'n't no railroads dem days an' de onlies' way folks had
trabbelin' about was de steamboat which passed most every week, and de
stage coach which passed twice a week.
""Lawsy, man, dem was de days, and many de time atter my daddy, whose
name was Green Bonner, heard dat steamboat blow below Pickensville, he
would hitch up de mules to de waggin and foller Massa John on hossback
down to de landin' to fetch back de supply of sugar and coffee and
plow-tools needed on de plantation. Dey would take me 'long to hold de
mules and watch de waggin and it was a reglar picnic to me to see de big
shiney boat and watch de goin's on.
""Massa John Bonner sho' did 'pend on my daddy. De massa paid a thousand
green-back dollars for him down to Mobile. 'Nuf green-backs to wrap him
up in, he said, so he named him Green Bonner.
""Yes suh, we was all Baptis'-de deep water kind, and every Sunday dey
used to pile us into de waggins and pull out bright and early for Big
Creek Church on the Carrollton road. Everybody fetched a big basket of
grub and, sakes alive! sech another dinner you never see, all spread out
on de grassy grove by de ole graveyard. Mos' all de quality white folks
belonged at Big Creek and when dere slaves got sho' nuff 'ligion, dey
have 'em jine at Big Creek and be baptized at de swimmin' hole. Some of
de niggers want to have dere own meetin's, but Lawd chile, dem niggers
get happy and get to shoutin' all over de meadow where dey built a brush
arbor. Massa John quick put a stop to dat. He say, 'if you gwine to
preach and sing you must turn de wash pot bottom up'; meanin', no
shoutin'. Dem Baptis' at Big Creek was sho' tight wid dere rules too.
Turn you out sho' if you drink too much cawn licker, or dance, or cuss.
""Massa John had a big fine bird dog. She was a mammy dog and one day she
foun' six puppies out in de harness house. Dey was mos' all girl puppies
so massa gwine drown 'em. I axed him to give 'em to me and purty soon de
missus sent me to de pos'office, so I put de puppies in a basket and
took 'em wid me. Dr. Lyles come by whar I was settin' and he say, 'Want
to sell dem pups, Siney?' I tell him, uh-huh. Den he say, 'What
'nomination is dey?'. I tell him, dey's Methodis' dogs. He didn' say no
mo'. Bout a week atter dat ole missus sent me to 'de pos'office again,
so I took my basket of puppies. Sho' nuff, 'long come Dr. Lyles and he
say, 'Siney, see you still ain't sold dem pups'. I say, 'Naw-suh'. Den
he axed me ag'in what 'nomination dey b'long to. I tole him dey was
Baptis' dogs. He say, 'How come? You tole me las' week dem was Methodis'
pups'. Ha-ha! Bless God!, look like he had me. But I say, 'Yas-suh, but
you see, Doctah, dey got dere eyes open since den!' He laff and go on
down to his newspaper office.

""How old is I? Law chile, I don't know. My mammy say I was fifteen year
old time of de surrender. I 'members dat mighty well. Massa John call
all de niggers on de plantation 'round him at de big house and he say
to 'em 'Now, you all jes' as free as I is. I ain't your marster no mo'.
I'se tried to be good to you and take keer of all of you. You is all
welcome to stay and we'll all wuk togedder and make a livin' somehow. Ef
you don' want to stay, dem dat go will jes' have to root, pig, or die.'
Some stayed and some lef'. My daddy stayed wid Marse John till he was
called home to glory. Now dey all gone but Siney, and I'se jes' here,
waitin' for 'em to call me.
""Yas suh, I been 'round Carrollton a heap. Atter Marse John and my daddy
bofe died, I wuk'd 'round from place to place. Used to wuk for Mrs.
Roper at de old Phoenix Hotel. I recollect when de new brick court house
was built. De ole court house had been burned and dey 'rested a nigger
named Bill Burkhalter for settin' it on fire. Dey sent him to de pen'
an' some officers started wid him to Montgomery. When dey got to Sipsey
River a mob ketched up wid 'em an' took Bill and hung him dere in the
swamp. 'Bout dat time a bad cloud come up. Dey axed Bill did he have
anything to say. He say, 'I ain't burn no court house, an' ef you all
kill me, my face gwine always ha'nt you'. Whilst he still hangin' dere
in dat swamp de lightnin' flash and de thunder an' wind was somp'n
awful. Nex' mornin' when de sun come up, bless my soul, right dere on de
winder in de court house tower was a photygraf of de face of de nigger
dey done hung for burnin' de old court house. Yas suh, I done seen dat
wid my own eyes an' I speck dat picture still dere.
""But lawsy me, I got to get goin', kase I'se cookin' me a mess of poke
sallet I picked down by de railroad tracks dis mornin'. Dat poke sallet
and young ernions gwine to be mighty good, and dey sho 'mind me of dem
good old days in Pickens county.""","Interview with Siney Bonner

Interview with Walter Calloway
-
W.F. Jordan
Walter Calloway lives alone half a block off Avenue F, the thoroughfare
on the southside of Birmingham on which live many of the leaders in the
Negro life of the city. For his eighty-nine years he was apparently
vigorous except for temporary illness. A glance at the interior of his
cabin disclosed the fact that it was scrupulously neat and quite orderly
in arrangement, a characteristic of a great many ex-slaves. As he sat in
the sunshine on his tiny front porch, his greeting was: ""Come in, white
folks. You ain't no doctor is you?""
To a negative reply, he explained as he continued, ""Fo' de las' past
twenty-five years I been keepin' right on, wukkin' for de city in de
street department. 'Bout two mont's ago dis mis'ry attackted me an'
don't 'pear lak nothin' dem doctors gimme do no good. De preacher he
come to see me dis mornin' an' he say he know a white gemman doctor,
what he gwine to sen' him to see me. I sho' wants to git well ag'in
pow'ful bad, but mebby I done live long 'nuff an' my time 'bout come.""
Quizzed about his age and antecedents, he began his story: ""Well, sir,
Cap'n, I was born in Richmond, Virginny, in 1848. Befo' I was ole 'nuff
to 'member much, my mammy wid me an' my older brudder was sold to Marse
John Calloway at Snowdoun in Montgomery county, ten miles south of de
town of Montgomery.
""Marse John hab a big plantation an' lots of slaves. Dey treated us
purty good, but we hab to wuk hard. Time I was ten years ole I was
makin' a reg'lar han' 'hin' de plow. Oh, yassuh, Marse John good 'nough
to us an' we git plenty to eat, but he had a oberseer name Green Bush
what sho' whup us iffen we don't do to suit him. Yassuh, he' mighty rough
wid us but he didn't do de whuppin' hisse'f. He had a big black boy
name Mose, mean as de debil an' strong as a ox, and de oberseer let him
do all de whuppin'. An', man, he could sho' lay on dat rawhide lash. He
whupped a nigger gal 'bout thirteen years ole so hard she nearly die,
an' allus atterwa'ds she hab spells of fits or somp'n. Dat make Marse
John pow'ful mad, so he run dat oberseer off de place an' Mose didn' do
no mo' whuppin.
""Same time Marse John buy mammy an' us boys, he buy a black man name
Joe. He a preacher an' de marster let de slaves buil' a brush arbor in
de pecan grove ober in de big pastur', an' when de wedder warn't too
cold all de slaves was 'lowed to meet dar on Sunday 'fo' preachin'.
""Yassuh, ole Joe do purty good. I spec he had mo' 'ligion dan some of de
hifalutin' niggers 'tendin' to preach nowadays. De white folks chu'ch,
hit at Hope Hill ober on de stage road, an' sometimes dey fetch 'dere
preacher to de plantation to preach to de slaves. But dey 'druther heah
Joe.
""Nawsuh, we didn' git no schoolin' 'cep'in' befo' we got big 'nough to
wuk in de fiel' we go 'long to school wid de white chillun to take care
of 'em. Dey show us pictures an' tell us all dey kin, but it didn't
'mount to much.
Walter Calloway, Birmingham, Alabama
""When de war started 'mos' all I know 'bout it was all de white mens go
to Montgomery an' jine de army. My brudder, he 'bout fifteen year ole,
so he go 'long wid de ration wagon to Montgomery 'mos' ebry week. One
day he come back from Montgomery an' he say, 'Hell done broke loose in
Gawgy.' He couldn't tell us much 'bout what done happen, but de slaves
dey get all 'cited 'caze dey didn' know what to 'spect. Purty soon we
fin' out dat some of de big mens call a meetin' at de capitol on Goat
Hill in Montgomery. Dey 'lected Mista Jeff Davis president an' done
busted de Nunited States wide open.
""Atter dat dar warn't much happen on de plantation 'cep'in' gangs of
so'jers passin' th'ough gwine off to de war. Den 'bout ebry so often a

Interview with Henry Garry
-
W.F. Jordan, Birmingham, Alabama
""Howdy Cap'n! Kin you tell me how to fin' Jedge Ab's co't? I knowed
'zactly whar hit was in de ole co't house, but I gits all bumfuzzled
tryin' to fin' anybody in dis new buildin'.""
His name was Henry Garry. He wore a suit of faded and extensively
patched Confederate gray and a cap of the regulation porter's style. His
face bore the expression worn only by those of his race who had lived
and toiled in a much earlier and in many instances, happier day. In the
presence of ""white folks"" he was at ease, indicating an intimate
association and relationship among them and in their service.
""What business have you in Judge Abernathy's court? You don't look like
a criminal,"" was the response.
""Oh, nawsah, I ain't neber done nothin' to nobody no time. But I sho'
don't know what dis new generation of nigguhs comin' to. Hit war bad
'nough when dey couldn' git nothin' but bootleg cawn licker; now dey kin
buy all de gin dey wants right here in Bummin'ham, an' dem rapscallions
git out on Sat'd'y night, fill up on gin an' git all lit up lak a
meetin' house. Den de fust thing dey know dey gits tangled up wid
somebody wid a razor or a meat axe or somp'n an' 'long come de law,
locks 'em up an' de debil's to pay.""
""But why should all that disturb you? They haven't run you in have
they?"" he was asked.
""Nawsuh, hits dat triflin' nevvew of mine. Dat boy kin sho' git into mo'
kin's of trouble dan a pet monkey. He in jail now for some debilment or
yuther an' I 'spect I'se gwine to hab to git him out ag'in. Dat's what
I'se gwine to see Jedge Ab 'bout. Wisht I could git dat boy back down in
Sumter County on Marse John Rogers' plantation. Dat's whar he b'long at.
Betcha Marse John wouldn' take none of his foolishment.""
""Are you familiar with the people and history of Sumter County?"" he was
quizzed further.
""Lawd man, I was bawn in de back yahd whar Marse John Rogers live right
now. Dat was right atter de surrender an' my mammy b'long to de
Vandegraaf family who useter live dar an' owned all dat plantation. My
daddy's name was Daniel Grady. Dey come f'um Virginny long time 'fo' de
wah. All dem ole peoples is dead now. Onlies' kinfolks I hab lef' down
dah is a cousin. She mos' a hundert yeahs ole an' still libs on her
little farm a few miles from Gainesville. An' Cap'n when I says libs, I
means libs. Ain't nothin' dat grow outten de groun' nor in de groun' in
Alabama dat's good for folks to eat but what she got it an' plenty. I
goes down dar to visit her twicet a yeah, an', man alive, hit am a sin
de 'mount of grub I puts away endurin' dem two weeks I stays dar.
Yassah, I'se 'bout due to go down dah now, 'caze dat gyarden sass en'
spring chickens jes' 'bout ripe.
""My mammy was a seamstress for de Vandegraaf plantation an' made all de
clothes for bofe black and white. She neber did leave de plantation
atter de slaves was freed but stayed right dar till she died, she an' my
daddy bofe. But dey was good hones', 'spectable, chu'ch-goin' people, my
daddy an' mammy was. De little log chu'ch house is still dar an' de
niggers still keeps up de services. De ole pastor nearly a hundert
yeahs ole now, but it would s'prise you how spry he gits 'bout an'
conduc's de meetin's.
""I don't know 'bout yuther parts, but from what my mammy tell me de
slaves in Sumter County mus' hab had a mighty good time, had plenty of
ebery t'ing an' nothin' to worry 'bout. Seems lak dar warn't no trouble
'mongst de whites an' blacks 'twell atter de wah. Some white mens come
down from de Norf' an' mess up wid de niggers. I was a mighty little
shaver, but I 'members one night atter supper, my daddy and mammy an' us
chilluns was settin' under a big tree by our cabin in de quarters when
all at wunst, lickety split, heah come gallopin' down de road what look
lak a whole army of ghos'es. Mus' hab been 'bout a hundert an' dey was
men ridin' hosses wid de men and hosses bofe robed in white.
""Cap'n, dem mens look lak dey ten feet high an' dey hosses big as
elephan's. Dey didn't bodder nobody at de qua'ters, but de leader of de
crowd ride right in de front gate an' up to de big dug well back of our
cabin an' holler to my daddy. 'Come heah nigguh! Ho-oh!, 'cose we
skeered. Yassuh, look lak our time done come.
""My daddy went ober to whar he settin' on his hoss at de well. Den he
say, 'Nigguh git a bucket an' draw me some cool water.' Daddy got a
bucket, fill it up an' han' it to him. Cap'n, would you b'lieve it? Dat
man jes' lif' dat bucket to his mouf' an' neber stop twell it empty. Did
he hab 'nough? He jes' smack his mouf an' call for mo'. Jes' lak dat, he
didn' stop twell he drunk three buckets full. Den he jes' wipe his mouf
an' say, 'Lawdy, dat sho' was good. Hit was de fust drink of water I'se
had sence I was killed at de battle of Shiloh.'
""Was we good? Cap'n, from den on dar wasn't a nigger dare stick his head
out de do' fo' a week. But nex' day we fin' out dey was Ku Kluxes an'
dey foun' de body of a white man hangin' to a pos' oak tree ober by
Gran' Prairie. His name was Billings an' he come from de Norf. He been
ober 'roun' Livingston messin' up de niggers tellin' 'em dey had been
promised forty acres and a mule, an' dey ought to go 'head an' take 'em
from de white folks.
""But dat carpetbagger couldn' do nothin' wid ole Slick 'dough. Slick?
Yassah, dat what ebe'ybody call him. He hang 'roun' de co'te house at
Livingston an' listen to de lawyers argufy. He try to 'member all de big
words dem lawyers use. When dat carpetbagger come to town dat nigger
Slick was carryin' his bag to de hotel an' when dey pass de mineral well
in de street, de man axed Slick, 'What dat water good for? Hab it been
tested?' Slick say, 'Oh yassah, dat water been scanalyzed by de bes'
fenologists in de country, an' dey say hit's three quarters carbolic
acid gas, an' de yuther seben eights is hydrophobia.'
""Yassah, dat ole cannon in de co'te house yahd at Livingston was drug
outten de Tombigbee ribber whar de Yankees done sunk it time of de wah.
De Men's useter load 'er up an' shoot 'er off on big days at Livingston.
Dey had to spike de ole gun, 'dough, to keep de deblish boys 'roun' town
from shootin' it off jes' fo' fun.
""Git rid of de carpetbaggers? Oh yassah, dey vote 'em out. Well, sah,
tell you how dey done dat. De 'publicans done paid all de niggers' poll
tax, an' gib 'em a receipt so dey could vote same as de whites. Dey made
up to 'lect de officers at de co't house all niggers an' den sen'
yuther ones to Montgomery to make de laws. Same day de 'lection come off
dar was a circus in Livingston an' de Demmycrats 'suaded de boss man of
de circus to let all Sumter County niggers in de show by showin' dere
poll tax receipts. Yessah, when de show was ober de 'lection was ober
too, an' nobody was 'lected 'cepin' white Demmycrats.
""'Cose dat made Sumter County a mighty onhealthy place for carpetbaggers
an' uppity niggers.
Henry Garry, Birmingham, Alabama
""Yo' ax me 'bout de old songs de slaves useter sing. Well, I don't
'members many of dem. Atter de S'render all de ole slaves what stayed on
de plantations 'roun' Gainesville useter gather at de landin' dar
waitin' to see de steamboats pull in from down de Tombigbee on dere way
to Columbus, (Miss.), an' somebody'd start a song, an', Law' man, how
dem niggers sing. Here one I heerd my mammy sing so much I learnt it:
""Read in de bible, understan'
Methuselah was de oldes' man.
He lived nine hundred an' sixty nine
Den died an' go to Heben in de Lawd's due time.
Methuselah was a witness
For my Lawd,
For my Lawd.
""Read in de Bible, Understan'
Samson was de stronges' man.
Went out to battle to fight one time
Killed a thousan' of de Philistines.
Samson was a witness
For my Lawd,
For my Lawd.
""Daniel was a Hebrew chile,
Went to de Lawd to pray a while.
De Lawd tole de angels de lions to keep,
So Daniel lay down an' went to sleep.
An' dat's anoder witness
For my Lawd,
For my Lawd.
""Now 'bout de ghos' tales. I neber heerd many ghos' yarns 'cep' 'bout de
chinyberry tree whar dey hung Mistah Steve Renfroe. He was 'lected High
Sheriff dat time dey got all de niggers to go to de circus 'stead of
goin' to de 'lection. He a fine lookin' man an' ride a big white hoss
an' ebe'ybody lak him a lot 'cep' de carpetbaggers an' boddersome
niggers. No matter whar, if he meet one of 'em, he look 'em squar' in de
eye for a minute, den 'bout all he say would be, 'Get to hell outten
heah!' An' man, iffen dey could fly dat would be too slow trabelin' for
'em, gettin' outten de county. But atter while he got in trouble 'bout
money matters. Dey say he got color blind, couldn' tell his money from
de county's. So dey 'rest him an' put him in jail, but he bust right out
an' run off. Atter while he sneak back an' 'caze his Ku Klux frien's
wouldn' help him outten de trouble when he got back in jail, he give 'em
away an' tell what dere name was. One night a gang took him outten de
Livingston jail an' go 'bout a mile outten town an' hang him to a
chinyberry tree. I'se hyeard iffen you go to dat tree today an' kinda
tap on hit an say, 'Renfroe, Renfroe; what did you do?' De tree say
right back at you, 'Nothin'.'
""Nawsuh, folks down 'roun' Gainesville didn' pay much min' to signs an'
conju' an' all dat stuff. My mammy wouldn' let us tote a axe on our
shoulder th'ough de house, an' she wouldn' 'low a umbrella to be opened
in de house, say hit bring bad luck. She neber fail to hab cown-fiel'
peas an hawg-jowl for dinner on New Yeah's Day. She say hit a sign you
hab plenty to eat balance ob de yeah. She put a ball of asafetida on a
string an' make all us chillun wear it 'roun' our neck to keep off
sickness. If a owl begin to hoot ober in Tombigbee bottom too close to
de house, she put de shovel in de fire to make him stop.
""Wall, sir, I come to Bummin'ham mos' forty yeahs ago when Marse Josiah
Morris finish de Morris Hotel. I fust run de elevators a while, den dey
wukked me in de saloon what useter be jes' back of de office. I been
heah eber sence. I 'speck 'bout de las' thing dat'll happen to dis ole
nigguh will be to haul him away from de Morris Hotel in a black box.
""But Lawdy, Cap'n, I got to git up to Jedge Ab's co't. Lissen, Cap'n,
iffen I gits dat no'count nevvew outten jail I sho' would lak to git him
a job. You don't know nobody what don't want to hire nobody to do
nothin' does you?""","Interview with Henry Garry

Personal interview with Nelson and Virginia Birdsong
Summerville, on Front Street

Ila B. Prine, Mobile, Alabama
Nelson Birdsong, who lives on Front Street in the old suburb of
Summerville, about three miles from Mobile, Alabama, was born
a slave. A tall dark Negro man, with white hair and whiskers,
he says he was born at Montgomery Hill, Alabama in Baldwin
County, and that his people and he were owned by Mr. Tom Adkins.
Nelson said he was very small at the time of the Surrender, and could
not tell very much about slavery days. In fact, he adds, ""You know,
missie, old folks in dem days did'nt 'low chillun to stan' 'roun' when
dey was talking. We chillun was lack a shot out of a gun when anybody
come in. We was glad when folks come in 'cause we c'ud run out an' play.
Chillun now-a-days knows as much as we did when we was twenty-five years
old.""
Nelson does remember his ""massa"" saying he neber was going to 'let dat
little nigger work.'
He did not remember much about coming to Mobile, but ""seemed lack"" his
""mammy worked for Mrs. Dunn on Monroe street, and later dey moved out in
old Napoleonville"" (which is now Crichton, Alabama, a suburb of
Mobile). He said his ""Pa and Mammy den worked fo' gris' mill out dere,
and also owned a big gris' mill in de fork whar de big fire station is
now"" (which is located at the intersection of St. Francis street and
Washington Avenue, the latter formerly Wilkinson street). This grist
mill was burned in the 1870's.
Nelson says the first work he remembered doing was ""nussing a baby boy
of Mr. Bramwell Burden, a gran'son of old man Burden.""
Nelson has owned his little farm and three-room house until the past two
or three years. He said he scuffled and tried to pay de taxes, but had
got so old and his ""knees had give out on him, and I seed I was agoin'
to lose mah place so I turned it over to a man to keep up mah taxes, so
I'd have a place to lib. De relief gibes me a little he'p now, an' me
an' my wife makes out de bes' we can.""
The house is the familiar type of two-room Negro house, with a porch
across the front, and a shed room on the back. The bedroom had been
papered with scraps of wallpaper of varied designs and so old that most
of it had fallen off. The mantel is covered with the colored comics
section, cut in a fancy pattern of scallops. At the entrance of the
house is a sack nailed to the floor and used for a foot mat, and at the
two upper corners of the door are horse shoes for good luck. Nelson said
he is a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, and has
been a Methodist all his life; that he and his wife Virginia ""had only
two chillun' and dey were bofe dead.""
Nelson's wife, Virginia, came from a family of slaves, although she was
not one herself. She said her folks were owned by Mr. Joe Pickett of
Camden, Wilcox County, Alabama. She said she just can remember Mr. Joe
taking her in his buggy, and she called him ""Toe-Toe,"" as she couldn't
say his name plainly. She also said as she grew older she always spoke
of Mr. Joe, as ""my Papa,"" instead of ""my master,"" for ""he sho' was good
to me."" She remembers her mother being chambermaid on the ""Old
Eleanora,"" a boat on the Alabama river, and as a small child going back
and forth on the boat with her. When they finally settled in Mobile, her
mother worked for the family of Dr. Heustis who lived in the corner
house now occupied by the new Federal Court House and Custom House, at
St. Louis and St. Joseph streets.","Personal interview with Nelson and Virginia Birdsong

Interview with Charles Hayes

Mary A. Poole, Mobile
""Mistis,"" said Charles Hayes from his porch in Maysville, near Mobile,
Alabama, ""I was a little bitty nigger when de war broke out, an' I
belonged to Massa Ben Duncan who lived at Day's Landin' on de Alabamy
Ribber.
""Marse Ben's house was de regulation plantation wid slave quarters. Most
of de things us used was made raght dere on de plantation, sich as:
beds, buckets, tools, soap, brogans, breeches, an' chairs. Our
mattresses was either made outen cornshucks or cotton bolls. Us cooked
on an open fireplace, an' eve'y Sadday night us would go to de big house
for supplies. Marse Ben was good to his slaves an' he 'lowed dem to have
a little plot of groun' nex' to de cabins whar dey could raise dere own
little crop.
""My mammy was a fiel' han' an' my pappy was a mechanic an' he use to be
de handy man aroun' de big house, makin' eve'thing f'um churns an'
buckets to wagon wheels. My pappy also useta play de fiddle for de white
folks dances in de big house, an' he played it for de colored frolics
too. He sho could make dat thing sing.
""Us useta have all sorts of cures for de sick people, f'rinstance, us
used de Jerusalem weed cooked wid molasses into a candy for to give to
de chilluns to git rid of worms. Den us'd bile de root an' make a kinda
tea for de stomach worms. You know de kinds dat little puppies an'
little chilluns has dat eats all de food dat goes in to de stomach, an'
makes de chile or dog eat plenty but don't git no benefits f'um all
dey're eatin'. Horehound, dat growed wild in Clarke County, was used for
colds. Mullen tea was used for colds an' swollen j'ints. Den dere was de
life everlastin' tea dat was also good for colds and horse mint tea dat
was good for de chills an' fevers. Co'se, Mistis, us niggers had a
regular fambly doctah dat 'tended to us when we was sho 'nough down
raght sick, but dese remedies I's tellin' you 'bout us used when warn't
nothin' much ailin' us. It was always to de owner's interest, Mistis, to
have de niggers in a good, healthy condition.
""Does I believe in spirits, you says? Sho I does. When Christ walked on
de water, de Apostles was skeered he was a spirit, but Jesus told dem
dat he warn't no spirit, dat he was as 'live as dey was. He tol' 'em dat
spirits couldn't be teched, dat dey jus' melted when you tried to. So,
Mistis, Jesus musta meant dat dere was sich a thing as spirits.
""Atter de war my pappy an' mammy stayed on de Duncan plantation en'
worked on share crops. Dere was a school on de groun's for us slave
chilluns, an' my gran'mammy, Salina Duncan, taught de bible, 'ca'se she
was f'um Virginny an' had been learnt to read an' write by her Mistis up
dere.
""My fus' wife was named Alice Bush, an' us had ten chilluns; my second
one was named Caroline Turner an' us didn't have but eight. Both my ole
womens is daid now, white folks, an' I stays here wid one of my
daughters. You see, my eyesight is almos' gone due to one day when I was
a workin' in de forge, a hot piece of iron flew up an' landed in my eye.
'Twarn't long befo' it started to hurtin' in my udder eye. Now both is
'bout to give out.""","Interview with Charles Hayes

Interview with Charles Hayes

Mary A. Poole, Mobile
""Mistis,"" said Charles Hayes from his porch in Maysville, near Mobile,
Alabama, ""I was a little bitty nigger when de war broke out, an' I
belonged to Massa Ben Duncan who lived at Day's Landin' on de Alabamy
Ribber.
""Marse Ben's house was de regulation plantation wid slave quarters. Most
of de things us used was made raght dere on de plantation, sich as:
beds, buckets, tools, soap, brogans, breeches, an' chairs. Our
mattresses was either made outen cornshucks or cotton bolls. Us cooked
on an open fireplace, an' eve'y Sadday night us would go to de big house
for supplies. Marse Ben was good to his slaves an' he 'lowed dem to have
a little plot of groun' nex' to de cabins whar dey could raise dere own
little crop.
""My mammy was a fiel' han' an' my pappy was a mechanic an' he use to be
de handy man aroun' de big house, makin' eve'thing f'um churns an'
buckets to wagon wheels. My pappy also useta play de fiddle for de white
folks dances in de big house, an' he played it for de colored frolics
too. He sho could make dat thing sing.
""Us useta have all sorts of cures for de sick people, f'rinstance, us
used de Jerusalem weed cooked wid molasses into a candy for to give to
de chilluns to git rid of worms. Den us'd bile de root an' make a kinda
tea for de stomach worms. You know de kinds dat little puppies an'
little chilluns has dat eats all de food dat goes in to de stomach, an'
makes de chile or dog eat plenty but don't git no benefits f'um all
dey're eatin'. Horehound, dat growed wild in Clarke County, was used for
colds. Mullen tea was used for colds an' swollen j'ints. Den dere was de
life everlastin' tea dat was also good for colds and horse mint tea dat
was good for de chills an' fevers. Co'se, Mistis, us niggers had a
regular fambly doctah dat 'tended to us when we was sho 'nough down
raght sick, but dese remedies I's tellin' you 'bout us used when warn't
nothin' much ailin' us. It was always to de owner's interest, Mistis, to
have de niggers in a good, healthy condition.
""Does I believe in spirits, you says? Sho I does. When Christ walked on
de water, de Apostles was skeered he was a spirit, but Jesus told dem
dat he warn't no spirit, dat he was as 'live as dey was. He tol' 'em dat
spirits couldn't be teched, dat dey jus' melted when you tried to. So,
Mistis, Jesus musta meant dat dere was sich a thing as spirits.
""Atter de war my pappy an' mammy stayed on de Duncan plantation en'
worked on share crops. Dere was a school on de groun's for us slave
chilluns, an' my gran'mammy, Salina Duncan, taught de bible, 'ca'se she
was f'um Virginny an' had been learnt to read an' write by her Mistis up
dere.
""My fus' wife was named Alice Bush, an' us had ten chilluns; my second
one was named Caroline Turner an' us didn't have but eight. Both my ole
womens is daid now, white folks, an' I stays here wid one of my
daughters. You see, my eyesight is almos' gone due to one day when I was
a workin' in de forge, a hot piece of iron flew up an' landed in my eye.
'Twarn't long befo' it started to hurtin' in my udder eye. Now both is
'bout to give out.""","Interview with Charles Hayes

Interview with Lucy Kimball

Francois Ludgere Diard, Mobile, Alabama
I made two visits to the home of Mammy Lucy Kimball. The first was
during the month of April, 1937; the next was nearly a month later. On
the first trip I had a very successful talk with the old Negro woman,
but on the last, she wasn't at home, and so the information I sought had
to wait. I was very disappointed that I couldn't see her on my second
venture, but it was impossible.
Mammy Lucy had not grown very feeble when I last saw her, and her
methodical mode of living can be attributed to her consciousness of the
venerable age of eighty-five years which she had reached. She was born
into slavery in 1851 at Swift's Landing near the town of Blakeley, in
Baldwin County. She was a slave in the Charles Hall family of that
county before and during the War between the States. In 1907, she came
to work for the T.S. Fry and Santos Rubira families of Mobile.
Following the War between the States, Mammy Lucy Kimball worked in
various families at the summer resorts of Baldwin County.
When a young girl, Mammy Lucy performed the duties of a children's
nurse, and worked as a dining room servant. She had some education, and
as she had worked in families of refinement and culture all her life,
her manner was that of a well educated person. However, like the average
educated Negro, she still displayed the characteristics of the Negro of
the ante-bellum days. She said that she strictly adhered to old
fashioned methods, such as: going to church twice a week, not believing
in doctors, and always taking home-concocted remedies.
I asked her if she believed in carrying a rabbit's foot for luck, to
which she responded:
""Honey, you don' think I'm like these other Negroes, who still believe
in that old nonsense? I might tell the children that a rabbit foot
brings good luck because it is an old custom for superstitions persons
to carry one, but, honey, you'd have just as good luck if you carried
brick-bats in your coat. My white people in Baldwin County never brought
me up to believe in such things.""
""Well, Mammy Lucy,"" I asked, ""do you remember any strange or weird
things that happened during the Civil War?""
""Yes,"" she answered slowly, ""I remember during the Civil War some of the
mischievous Sibley boys who were kin to the Hall family over in Baldwin
County, tied a strange long black thread to the ankle of a black boy
named Slow Poke.
""Some Negroes were going to town that night to fetch supplies and among
them was Slow Poke. The boys jokingly asked him if he had his rabbit
foot with him as he might need it to keep the rattling noises away at
night. Slow Poke showed them his rabbit foot and, displaying his
glistening teeth in a broad grin he said that there 'warn't goin' to be
no ghosties atter him.' The boys deftly tied a string to Slow Poke's
ankle while some of their friends held his attention. On this string
were attached three cow bladders. Slow Poke hadn't gone far when he
heard the bladders rattling at his heels. He immediately decided that
there was a whole troop of ghosts after him, and so began to hit his
fastest gait down the middle of the dark road. He ran till he reached
Montgomery Hill some miles distant, where the string finally wore out.
His people didn't find him till three days later. Then they took him
home and gave him a sound whipping for running away.""
Mammy Lucy talked of the Hall and Sibley families and of the wealth that
they once had, and what happiness she found in being slave to such good
people. She remembered all the summer resorts on the eastern shore of
Mobile Bay when they were in their glory before the Civil War, and how
the Mobile ferries landed bringing over all the fashionable Mobile
families to their summer homes on the bay. She remembered hearing father
Ryan, the poet-priest of the south, preaching at the dedication of the
Catholic Church at Montrose and the storm in the '70's which almost
demolished Alabama City (now Fairhope). She recalls the landing of the
Confederate troops at Hollywood for wood when they left Mobile at the
outbreak of the war on their way to Fort Pickens, Florida, to enter
active service.
I found Mammy Lucy to be neat and prim as she must have been thirty
years ago, when she first went to work for the Fry and Rubira families.
She still walks with the agility of a young person, and her mind is
fertile with fresh thoughts and with the deeds of the past. ""I have
found happiness,"" she said. ""People have been good to me and I, in
return, have tried to be kind to those around me. I have lived a plain
life and have been rewarded with a ripe age that still finds me feeling
young. I shall never grow old in my thoughts and actions, but always
keep a place in my mind to welcome something new. I will have had a
complete life if I can live only two weeks longer. There is something
I'd like to see.""
After a few more minutes I left her and returned home. There was
something I wanted to ask Mammy Lucy; something that preyed on my mind
for days. I wanted to ask her what the thing was that she wanted to see.
She was so gentle and courteous; my interest seemed officious prying
into her affairs. Someday I shall go to see her again, I decided, and
bring up the subject casually. Then she'll never know of my unworthy
curiosity.
Three weeks later I walked to the door of Mammy Lucy's cabin and on the
porch stood a Negro girl watering a few pots of flowers.
""Is Mammy Lucy at home?"" I asked.
The girl was silent for a moment, then she spoke in a high-pitched
whining voice: ""Mammy Lucy, she died.""
""Oh, I'm sorry,"" I said. ""When did she die?""
""Fo' days ago,"" was the reply.
I walked down the path of pebbles toward the bay. The question would
never be answered, but I knew that Mammy Lucy died content.","Interview with Lucy Kimball

Interview with Lucy Kimball
-
Francois Ludgere Diard, Mobile, Alabama
I made two visits to the home of Mammy Lucy Kimball. The first was
during the month of April, 1937; the next was nearly a month later. On
the first trip I had a very successful talk with the old Negro woman,
but on the last, she wasn't at home, and so the information I sought had
to wait. I was very disappointed that I couldn't see her on my second
venture, but it was impossible.
Mammy Lucy had not grown very feeble when I last saw her, and her
methodical mode of living can be attributed to her consciousness of the
venerable age of eighty-five years which she had reached. She was born
into slavery in 1851 at Swift's Landing near the town of Blakeley, in
Baldwin County. She was a slave in the Charles Hall family of that
county before and during the War between the States. In 1907, she came
to work for the T.S. Fry and Santos Rubira families of Mobile.
Following the War between the States, Mammy Lucy Kimball worked in
various families at the summer resorts of Baldwin County.
When a young girl, Mammy Lucy performed the duties of a children's
nurse, and worked as a dining room servant. She had some education, and
as she had worked in families of refinement and culture all her life,
her manner was that of a well educated person. However, like the average
educated Negro, she still displayed the characteristics of the Negro of
the ante-bellum days. She said that she strictly adhered to old
fashioned methods, such as: going to church twice a week, not believing
in doctors, and always taking home-concocted remedies.
I asked her if she believed in carrying a rabbit's foot for luck, to
which she responded:
""Honey, you don' think I'm like these other Negroes, who still believe
in that old nonsense? I might tell the children that a rabbit foot
brings good luck because it is an old custom for superstitions persons
to carry one, but, honey, you'd have just as good luck if you carried
brick-bats in your coat. My white people in Baldwin County never brought
me up to believe in such things.""
""Well, Mammy Lucy,"" I asked, ""do you remember any strange or weird
things that happened during the Civil War?""
""Yes,"" she answered slowly, ""I remember during the Civil War some of the
mischievous Sibley boys who were kin to the Hall family over in Baldwin
County, tied a strange long black thread to the ankle of a black boy
named Slow Poke.
""Some Negroes were going to town that night to fetch supplies and among
them was Slow Poke. The boys jokingly asked him if he had his rabbit
foot with him as he might need it to keep the rattling noises away at
night. Slow Poke showed them his rabbit foot and, displaying his
glistening teeth in a broad grin he said that there 'warn't goin' to be
no ghosties atter him.' The boys deftly tied a string to Slow Poke's
ankle while some of their friends held his attention. On this string
were attached three cow bladders. Slow Poke hadn't gone far when he
heard the bladders rattling at his heels. He immediately decided that
there was a whole troop of ghosts after him, and so began to hit his
fastest gait down the middle of the dark road. He ran till he reached
Montgomery Hill some miles distant, where the string finally wore out.
His people didn't find him till three days later. Then they took him
home and gave him a sound whipping for running away.""
Mammy Lucy talked of the Hall and Sibley families and of the wealth that
they once had, and what happiness she found in being slave to such good
people. She remembered all the summer resorts on the eastern shore of
Mobile Bay when they were in their glory before the Civil War, and how
the Mobile ferries landed bringing over all the fashionable Mobile
families to their summer homes on the bay. She remembered hearing father
Ryan, the poet-priest of the south, preaching at the dedication of the
Catholic Church at Montrose and the storm in the '70's which almost
demolished Alabama City (now Fairhope). She recalls the landing of the
Confederate troops at Hollywood for wood when they left Mobile at the
outbreak of the war on their way to Fort Pickens, Florida, to enter
active service.
I found Mammy Lucy to be neat and prim as she must have been thirty
years ago, when she first went to work for the Fry and Rubira families.
She still walks with the agility of a young person, and her mind is
fertile with fresh thoughts and with the deeds of the past. ""I have
found happiness,"" she said. ""People have been good to me and I, in
return, have tried to be kind to those around me. I have lived a plain
life and have been rewarded with a ripe age that still finds me feeling
young. I shall never grow old in my thoughts and actions, but always
keep a place in my mind to welcome something new. I will have had a
complete life if I can live only two weeks longer. There is something
I'd like to see.""
After a few more minutes I left her and returned home. There was
something I wanted to ask Mammy Lucy; something that preyed on my mind
for days. I wanted to ask her what the thing was that she wanted to see.
She was so gentle and courteous; my interest seemed officious prying
into her affairs. Someday I shall go to see her again, I decided, and
bring up the subject casually. Then she'll never know of my unworthy
curiosity.
Three weeks later I walked to the door of Mammy Lucy's cabin and on the
porch stood a Negro girl watering a few pots of flowers.
""Is Mammy Lucy at home?"" I asked.
The girl was silent for a moment, then she spoke in a high-pitched
whining voice: ""Mammy Lucy, she died.""
""Oh, I'm sorry,"" I said. ""When did she die?""
""Fo' days ago,"" was the reply.
I walked down the path of pebbles toward the bay. The question would
never be answered, but I knew that Mammy Lucy died content.","Interview with Lucy Kimball

barrel meant Us, so us commence' to eat. When de oberseer come to gib us
de meat an' 'lasses, us be done et it all up.
""Us slaves useta git up at dawn; de oberseer blowed a cow hawn to call
us to work. De Hunter slaves was 'lowed to go avisitin' udder slaves
atter work hours an' on Sundays, an' iffen we was to meet a pattyroller,
an' he axe us whar we f'um an' who we b'long to all us had to say was
we's Hunter niggers; an' dat pattyroller didn't do nothin', caze de
Hunter niggers warn't neber whupped by no pattyroller. Some niggers
when dey was kotched eben dough dey warn't Hunter niggers, dey'd say it
jus' de same, caze dem pattyrollers was always 'fraid to fool 'long wid
a Hunter nigger. Massa Hunter, he was somp'n'.
""Durin' de Christmas celebration, us all had gif's. Us had quilting
bee's wid de white folks, an' iffen a white gent'man th'owed a quilt
ober a white lady he was 'titled to a kiss an' a hug f'um her. Atter de
celebratin' we all had a big supper.
""An' speakin' of cures, white folks, us niggers had 'em. My grandmammy
was a midwife an' she useta gib women cloves an' whiskey to ease de
pain. She also gib 'em dried watermelon seeds to git rid of de grabel in
de kidneys. For night sweats Grandmammy would put an axe under de bed of
de sick pusson wid de blade asittin' straight up. An' iffen yo' is sick
an' wants to keep de visitors away, jus' putt a fresh laid aig in front
of de do' an' dey won't come in. If you is anxious fo' yo' sweetheart to
come back f'um a trip put a pin in de groun' wid de point up an' den put
a aig on de point. When all de insides runs outen de aig yo' sweetheart
will return.
""Yassuh, white folks, us useta hab games. Us useta play, 'Puss in de
cawner,' 'Next do' neighbor' an' 'Fox an' geese.' I kin gib you some of
de songs we useta sing:
Old sweet beans and barley grows,
Old sweet beans an' barley grows,
You nor I nor nobody knows,
Where old sweet beans an' barley grows.
Go choose yo' east,
Go choose yo' wes',
Go choose de one dat you love best,
If she's not here to take her part,
Choose de nex' one to yo' heart.
""I is always been a 'piscopalian in belief, white folks. I
ma'ied Bill Lewis when I was fifteen year old in Montgomery an' us had
three chilluns. I is strong in my faith.
In mercy, not in wrath,
Rebuke me, gracious Lawd
Les' when Dy whole displeasure rise,
I sink beneath Dy rod.
""Yassuh, I remembers de war. I seed de Yankees a-marchin' through our
place an' down de road dat led to Portland in Dallas County. Dey was
mighty fine looking wid all dere brass buttons and nice lookin'
uniforms. Dey didn't gib us much trouble. Dey had a Cap'n dat was good
an' kin'. I heered him say dat dere warn't agoin' to be no stealin' an'
atrampin' through folks' houses. Dey slep' outen de yard for one night;
den dey went on in to Portland.
""Mr. Munger was our oberseer, but he had money of his own. He was better
dan mos' oberseers, an' dere warn't no po' white trash, dem onery
buckers libed further back in de woods.
""When us was sick Dr Lewis Williams, who was de doctor of de massa,
'tended to us slaves. I remembers sittin' in de doctor's lap while he
tried to soothe my ailments.
""Us house servants was taught to read by de white folks, but my
gran'-mammy, Alvain Hunter, dat didn't have no learnin' but dat knowed
de Bible back'ards an' farwards, made us study. When me an' my brother
was learnin' outen de Blue Back Speller she say:
""'How's dat? Go ober it.'
""Den we would laugh an' answer, 'How you know? You can't read.'
""'Jus' don't soun' raght. De Lawd tell me when its raght. You-all can't
fool me so don't try.'
""When de marriages was performed, de massa read de ceremony an' de
couples would step off over a broomstick for luck. Den we all had a big
supper, an' dere was music an' dancin' by de plenty.""","Interview with Dellie Lewis

Interview with Dellie Lewis

Mary A. Poole, Mobile, Alabama
""To begin at de beginnin', white folks,"" said Dellie Lewis, ""I was bawn
on de plantation of Winston Hunter at Sunflower in Washington County,
Alabama. It's on de Southern Railroad. De fus' thing dat I remembers was
when de Gran' Trunk Railroad cut dere right of way through near
Sunflower. Dey had a chain gang of prisoners dat warn't slaves aworkin'
on de road, an' me an' anudder little nigger gal was sont wid big cans
of buttermilk to sell 'em. One day a handsome white gent'man rode to our
house an' axe me fo' a drink of cool water. He was de fo'man on de road.
Jus' as soon as I handed it to him he done fell offen his hoss on de
groun'. I run to de Mistis an' she got some of de niggers 'roun' de
place to ca'ay de gent'man to de big house, an' do you know it, white
folks, dat man, he neber open his eyes again! He keppa callin' de Mistis
his mammy, but he neber open his eyes to see dat she warn't his mammy.
He died a little later wid a conjested chill.
""Den I remembers one of de Alabama River floods, dat swep' ober de lan'
an' washed away lots of de food. De gover'ment sont some supplies of
meat, meal an' 'lasses. De barrels was marked U.S. an' one nigger, bein'
tired of waitin' an' bein' powerful hongry tol' us dat de U.S. on de
barrel meant Us, so us commence' to eat. When de oberseer come to gib us
de meat an' 'lasses, us be done et it all up.
""Us slaves useta git up at dawn; de oberseer blowed a cow hawn to call
us to work. De Hunter slaves was 'lowed to go avisitin' udder slaves
atter work hours an' on Sundays, an' iffen we was to meet a pattyroller,
an' he axe us whar we f'um an' who we b'long to all us had to say was
we's Hunter niggers; an' dat pattyroller didn't do nothin', caze de
Hunter niggers warn't neber whupped by no pattyroller. Some niggers
when dey was kotched eben dough dey warn't Hunter niggers, dey'd say it
jus' de same, caze dem pattyrollers was always 'fraid to fool 'long wid
a Hunter nigger. Massa Hunter, he was somp'n'.
""Durin' de Christmas celebration, us all had gif's. Us had quilting
bee's wid de white folks, an' iffen a white gent'man th'owed a quilt
ober a white lady he was 'titled to a kiss an' a hug f'um her. Atter de
celebratin' we all had a big supper.
""An' speakin' of cures, white folks, us niggers had 'em. My grandmammy
was a midwife an' she useta gib women cloves an' whiskey to ease de
pain. She also gib 'em dried watermelon seeds to git rid of de grabel in
de kidneys. For night sweats Grandmammy would put an axe under de bed of
de sick pusson wid de blade asittin' straight up. An' iffen yo' is sick
an' wants to keep de visitors away, jus' putt a fresh laid aig in front
of de do' an' dey won't come in. If you is anxious fo' yo' sweetheart to
come back f'um a trip put a pin in de groun' wid de point up an' den put
a aig on de point. When all de insides runs outen de aig yo' sweetheart
will return.
""Yassuh, white folks, us useta hab games. Us useta play, 'Puss in de
cawner,' 'Next do' neighbor' an' 'Fox an' geese.' I kin gib you some of
de songs we useta sing:
Old sweet beans and barley grows,
Old sweet beans an' barley grows,
You nor I nor nobody knows,
Where old sweet beans an' barley grows.
Go choose yo' east,
Go choose yo' wes',
Go choose de one dat you love best,
If she's not here to take her part,
Choose de nex' one to yo' heart.
""I is always been a 'piscopalian in belief, white folks. I
ma'ied Bill Lewis when I was fifteen year old in Montgomery an' us had
three chilluns. I is strong in my faith.
In mercy, not in wrath,
Rebuke me, gracious Lawd
Les' when Dy whole displeasure rise,
I sink beneath Dy rod.
""Yassuh, I remembers de war. I seed de Yankees a-marchin' through our
place an' down de road dat led to Portland in Dallas County. Dey was
mighty fine looking wid all dere brass buttons and nice lookin'
uniforms. Dey didn't gib us much trouble. Dey had a Cap'n dat was good
an' kin'. I heered him say dat dere warn't agoin' to be no stealin' an'
atrampin' through folks' houses. Dey slep' outen de yard for one night;
den dey went on in to Portland.
""Mr. Munger was our oberseer, but he had money of his own. He was better
dan mos' oberseers, an' dere warn't no po' white trash, dem onery
buckers libed further back in de woods.
""When us was sick Dr Lewis Williams, who was de doctor of de massa,
'tended to us slaves. I remembers sittin' in de doctor's lap while he
tried to soothe my ailments.
""Us house servants was taught to read by de white folks, but my
gran'-mammy, Alvain Hunter, dat didn't have no learnin' but dat knowed
de Bible back'ards an' farwards, made us study. When me an' my brother
was learnin' outen de Blue Back Speller she say:
""'How's dat? Go ober it.'
""Den we would laugh an' answer, 'How you know? You can't read.'
""'Jus' don't soun' raght. De Lawd tell me when its raght. You-all can't
fool me so don't try.'
""When de marriages was performed, de massa read de ceremony an' de
couples would step off over a broomstick for luck. Den we all had a big
supper, an' dere was music an' dancin' by de plenty.""","Interview with Dellie Lewis

Interview with Dellie Lewis

Mary A. Poole, Mobile, Alabama
""To begin at de beginnin', white folks,"" said Dellie Lewis, ""I was bawn
on de plantation of Winston Hunter at Sunflower in Washington County,
Alabama. It's on de Southern Railroad. De fus' thing dat I remembers was
when de Gran' Trunk Railroad cut dere right of way through near
Sunflower. Dey had a chain gang of prisoners dat warn't slaves aworkin'
on de road, an' me an' anudder little nigger gal was sont wid big cans
of buttermilk to sell 'em. One day a handsome white gent'man rode to our
house an' axe me fo' a drink of cool water. He was de fo'man on de road.
Jus' as soon as I handed it to him he done fell offen his hoss on de
groun'. I run to de Mistis an' she got some of de niggers 'roun' de
place to ca'ay de gent'man to de big house, an' do you know it, white
folks, dat man, he neber open his eyes again! He keppa callin' de Mistis
his mammy, but he neber open his eyes to see dat she warn't his mammy.
He died a little later wid a conjested chill.
""Den I remembers one of de Alabama River floods, dat swep' ober de lan'
an' washed away lots of de food. De gover'ment sont some supplies of
meat, meal an' 'lasses. De barrels was marked U.S. an' one nigger, bein'
tired of waitin' an' bein' powerful hongry tol' us dat de U.S. on de
barrel meant Us, so us commence' to eat. When de oberseer come to gib us
de meat an' 'lasses, us be done et it all up.
""Us slaves useta git up at dawn; de oberseer blowed a cow hawn to call
us to work. De Hunter slaves was 'lowed to go avisitin' udder slaves
atter work hours an' on Sundays, an' iffen we was to meet a pattyroller,
an' he axe us whar we f'um an' who we b'long to all us had to say was
we's Hunter niggers; an' dat pattyroller didn't do nothin', caze de
Hunter niggers warn't neber whupped by no pattyroller. Some niggers
when dey was kotched eben dough dey warn't Hunter niggers, dey'd say it
jus' de same, caze dem pattyrollers was always 'fraid to fool 'long wid
a Hunter nigger. Massa Hunter, he was somp'n'.
""Durin' de Christmas celebration, us all had gif's. Us had quilting
bee's wid de white folks, an' iffen a white gent'man th'owed a quilt
ober a white lady he was 'titled to a kiss an' a hug f'um her. Atter de
celebratin' we all had a big supper.
""An' speakin' of cures, white folks, us niggers had 'em. My grandmammy
was a midwife an' she useta gib women cloves an' whiskey to ease de
pain. She also gib 'em dried watermelon seeds to git rid of de grabel in
de kidneys. For night sweats Grandmammy would put an axe under de bed of
de sick pusson wid de blade asittin' straight up. An' iffen yo' is sick
an' wants to keep de visitors away, jus' putt a fresh laid aig in front
of de do' an' dey won't come in. If you is anxious fo' yo' sweetheart to
come back f'um a trip put a pin in de groun' wid de point up an' den put
a aig on de point. When all de insides runs outen de aig yo' sweetheart
will return.
""Yassuh, white folks, us useta hab games. Us useta play, 'Puss in de
cawner,' 'Next do' neighbor' an' 'Fox an' geese.' I kin gib you some of
de songs we useta sing:
Old sweet beans and barley grows,
Old sweet beans an' barley grows,
You nor I nor nobody knows,
Where old sweet beans an' barley grows.
Go choose yo' east,
Go choose yo' wes',
Go choose de one dat you love best,
If she's not here to take her part,
Choose de nex' one to yo' heart.
""I is always been a 'piscopalian in belief, white folks. I
ma'ied Bill Lewis when I was fifteen year old in Montgomery an' us had
three chilluns. I is strong in my faith.
In mercy, not in wrath,
Rebuke me, gracious Lawd
Les' when Dy whole displeasure rise,
I sink beneath Dy rod.
""Yassuh, I remembers de war. I seed de Yankees a-marchin' through our
place an' down de road dat led to Portland in Dallas County. Dey was
mighty fine looking wid all dere brass buttons and nice lookin'
uniforms. Dey didn't gib us much trouble. Dey had a Cap'n dat was good
an' kin'. I heered him say dat dere warn't agoin' to be no stealin' an'
atrampin' through folks' houses. Dey slep' outen de yard for one night;
den dey went on in to Portland.
""Mr. Munger was our oberseer, but he had money of his own. He was better
dan mos' oberseers, an' dere warn't no po' white trash, dem onery
buckers libed further back in de woods.
""When us was sick Dr Lewis Williams, who was de doctor of de massa,
'tended to us slaves. I remembers sittin' in de doctor's lap while he
tried to soothe my ailments.
""Us house servants was taught to read by de white folks, but my
gran'-mammy, Alvain Hunter, dat didn't have no learnin' but dat knowed
de Bible back'ards an' farwards, made us study. When me an' my brother
was learnin' outen de Blue Back Speller she say:
""'How's dat? Go ober it.'
""Den we would laugh an' answer, 'How you know? You can't read.'
""'Jus' don't soun' raght. De Lawd tell me when its raght. You-all can't
fool me so don't try.'
""When de marriages was performed, de massa read de ceremony an' de
couples would step off over a broomstick for luck. Den we all had a big
supper, an' dere was music an' dancin' by de plenty.""","Interview with Dellie Lewis

Interview with Isaam Morgan

Mary A. Poole, Mobile, Alabama
""Mr. James Morgan was my Massa, an' his wife, Miss Delia, was my Mistis.
My mammy's name was Ann Morgan, an' as for my pappy, I done forgot
his'n. I was raised raght dar in de white folks house, an' I had my own
special place to sleep. I was de house boy, an' when I growed older I
driv' Mistis aroun' in de Ca'iage.
""Us niggers lived in sho-'nuff style. Us had our regular quarters whar
us lived in white log cabins chinked wid mud, an' de slaves had built-in
beds an' a big open fireplace whar dey cooked. Us had plenty somp'n
t'eat. All us had to do was to ask for it an' de Massa done de res'. Our
rations was gib out to us eve'y Sadday. Some of de bes' food us ever had
was 'possum an' taters. Us'd go out at night wid a big sack, an' a pack
of houn's an' twarn't long befo' we done treed a 'possum. Atter we done
treed him, de dogs would stan' aroun' de tree an' bark. Iffen de tree
was small, us could shake him out. Iffen it was big, one of de niggers
hadda climb up it an' git ole Mr. 'Possum hisself.
""Funny things about 'possums, Miss; de bigger dey is seem lak de littler
de tree dey picks to go up. It is sho-'nuff fun, dough, to go a trailin'
th'ough de woods atter a 'possum or coon. De coon'll give you de bes'
chase, but he ain't no good eatin' lak de 'possum. I seen a coon one
time when he was cornered bite de tip of a houn's nose off.
""Massa Morgan sol' wood to de steam boats, an' us slaves hadda cut de
wood, an' split it up into smaller pieces. Any time a slave worked over
time or cut mo' wood dan he s'pose' to, Massa pay him money for it, caze
whenever one of us slaves seen somp'n we lak, we did jus' lak de white
folks does now. Us bought it.
""Massa never whupped none of his slaves; he jus' tole us whut to do an'
iffen we didn't do it, he'd call us to him an' he would say in his sorta
way: 'Nigger! How many mo' times is I gotta tell you to do lak you
tole?' Dat's all he would say, an' believe me Mistis, he hada a way of
lookin' at you dat made you jump. When he bought a new slave dat wasn't
use to doin' what he was tol', 'twarn't long befo' massa had him in
line.
""No'm none of our slaves ever tried to run away. Dey all knowed dey was
well off. We didn't have no oberseer but once. He was a mean un too. He
tried to fight an' whup us slaves, an' one night six big nigger men
jumped on him an' scairt him mos' to death. Atter dat de massa wouldn't
never have no mo' oberseers. He tended to dat business hisself.
""Whut we do atter we finished work? Go to bed! Dat was de onl'es' place
we was fittin' for. Us was so tired us wouldn't lie down two minutes 'fo
us was 'sleep. On some moonlight nights us was 'lowed to pick de cotton.
Den us'd git a little res' de nex' day.
""Massa an' his fambly used brass lamps an' candles for light, an' a few
of us slaves had brass lamps too, but most of de niggers used torch
lights.
""Some of de plantations had a calaboose whar dey putt de slaves dat
wouldn't behave. Dis calaboose was built of logs fastened together wid
stout ropes an' sunk into de groun', but Massa didn't need no calaboose
to make his niggers behave.
Isaam Morgan, Mobile, Alabama
""Yassum, us had remedies for ailments. We used wild hoarhound tea for de
chills an' fever, an' sweet gum turpentine, an' mutton suet. Dey wan all
good uns too. But shucks! Warn't nothin' much ever de matter wid us
niggers.
""Yassum, we used rock an' cotton to start de fires on de plantation, an'
Massa had a flint lock rifle, too.
""De slaves had dere own special graveyard an' us'd make de coffins raght
on de place dar. When someone die, he was taken in a ox cart to de
grave, wid all de slaves a-walkin' 'long behine de cart singin' de
spirituals.
""Our clothes was made mostly outen osnaburg wove on de plantation. We
had wool clothes for de winter time dat was carded on de place. We had
shoes made by our own cobbler an' tanned on de plantation. We called
dese brogans.
""Atter de surrender, de Yankees camped near our place, an' bought aigs
f'um us. Dey offered me a hoss iffen I would go nawth wid dem, but I
jus' couldn't leave de Massa even dough I did wanted dat hoss mighty
bad. I was twenty-one years old when Massa came to me one day an' say:
'Isaam, you is a grown man now. You is got to boss your own business.
It's up to you to fin' work. I can't keep you no longer. Good luck
Isaam. You has been a good nigger, an' you is gonna make somebody a good
worker.'
""Atter I lef' Massa I worked at diff'ent jobs, sich as: loader,
roustabout on different steamboats an' cotton picker. I worked on de
May Boyd
,
Lula D.
an' de
Gardner
. One of de ole songs sang on de
boats went somp'n lak dis:
De John T. Moore
De Lula D.
An' all dem boats is mine
If you can't ship on de Lula D.
You ain't no man o' mine.
""I been ma'ied three times, Mistis, an' Lawd chile I done forgot de name
of my fust wife. I guess she still livin' somewhere caze she was too
mean to die. My secon' wife was named Dora, an' she is daid. I got a
wife now name Lily. She purty good.
""Yes maam you can take my picture, but lemme git my hat, caze I ain't
got no hair on my haid, an' I looks better wid a hat. I'se got to be
fixed up stylish.""","Interview with Isaam Morgan

Interview with Isaam Morgan

Mary A. Poole, Mobile, Alabama
""Mr. James Morgan was my Massa, an' his wife, Miss Delia, was my Mistis.
My mammy's name was Ann Morgan, an' as for my pappy, I done forgot
his'n. I was raised raght dar in de white folks house, an' I had my own
special place to sleep. I was de house boy, an' when I growed older I
driv' Mistis aroun' in de Ca'iage.
""Us niggers lived in sho-'nuff style. Us had our regular quarters whar
us lived in white log cabins chinked wid mud, an' de slaves had built-in
beds an' a big open fireplace whar dey cooked. Us had plenty somp'n
t'eat. All us had to do was to ask for it an' de Massa done de res'. Our
rations was gib out to us eve'y Sadday. Some of de bes' food us ever had
was 'possum an' taters. Us'd go out at night wid a big sack, an' a pack
of houn's an' twarn't long befo' we done treed a 'possum. Atter we done
treed him, de dogs would stan' aroun' de tree an' bark. Iffen de tree
was small, us could shake him out. Iffen it was big, one of de niggers
hadda climb up it an' git ole Mr. 'Possum hisself.
""Funny things about 'possums, Miss; de bigger dey is seem lak de littler
de tree dey picks to go up. It is sho-'nuff fun, dough, to go a trailin'
th'ough de woods atter a 'possum or coon. De coon'll give you de bes'
chase, but he ain't no good eatin' lak de 'possum. I seen a coon one
time when he was cornered bite de tip of a houn's nose off.
""Massa Morgan sol' wood to de steam boats, an' us slaves hadda cut de
wood, an' split it up into smaller pieces. Any time a slave worked over
time or cut mo' wood dan he s'pose' to, Massa pay him money for it, caze
whenever one of us slaves seen somp'n we lak, we did jus' lak de white
folks does now. Us bought it.
""Massa never whupped none of his slaves; he jus' tole us whut to do an'
iffen we didn't do it, he'd call us to him an' he would say in his sorta
way: 'Nigger! How many mo' times is I gotta tell you to do lak you
tole?' Dat's all he would say, an' believe me Mistis, he hada a way of
lookin' at you dat made you jump. When he bought a new slave dat wasn't
use to doin' what he was tol', 'twarn't long befo' massa had him in
line.
""No'm none of our slaves ever tried to run away. Dey all knowed dey was
well off. We didn't have no oberseer but once. He was a mean un too. He
tried to fight an' whup us slaves, an' one night six big nigger men
jumped on him an' scairt him mos' to death. Atter dat de massa wouldn't
never have no mo' oberseers. He tended to dat business hisself.
""Whut we do atter we finished work? Go to bed! Dat was de onl'es' place
we was fittin' for. Us was so tired us wouldn't lie down two minutes 'fo
us was 'sleep. On some moonlight nights us was 'lowed to pick de cotton.
Den us'd git a little res' de nex' day.
""Massa an' his fambly used brass lamps an' candles for light, an' a few
of us slaves had brass lamps too, but most of de niggers used torch
lights.
""Some of de plantations had a calaboose whar dey putt de slaves dat
wouldn't behave. Dis calaboose was built of logs fastened together wid
stout ropes an' sunk into de groun', but Massa didn't need no calaboose
to make his niggers behave.
Isaam Morgan, Mobile, Alabama
""Yassum, us had remedies for ailments. We used wild hoarhound tea for de
chills an' fever, an' sweet gum turpentine, an' mutton suet. Dey wan all
good uns too. But shucks! Warn't nothin' much ever de matter wid us
niggers.
""Yassum, we used rock an' cotton to start de fires on de plantation, an'
Massa had a flint lock rifle, too.
""De slaves had dere own special graveyard an' us'd make de coffins raght
on de place dar. When someone die, he was taken in a ox cart to de
grave, wid all de slaves a-walkin' 'long behine de cart singin' de
spirituals.
""Our clothes was made mostly outen osnaburg wove on de plantation. We
had wool clothes for de winter time dat was carded on de place. We had
shoes made by our own cobbler an' tanned on de plantation. We called
dese brogans.
""Atter de surrender, de Yankees camped near our place, an' bought aigs
f'um us. Dey offered me a hoss iffen I would go nawth wid dem, but I
jus' couldn't leave de Massa even dough I did wanted dat hoss mighty
bad. I was twenty-one years old when Massa came to me one day an' say:
'Isaam, you is a grown man now. You is got to boss your own business.
It's up to you to fin' work. I can't keep you no longer. Good luck
Isaam. You has been a good nigger, an' you is gonna make somebody a good
worker.'
""Atter I lef' Massa I worked at diff'ent jobs, sich as: loader,
roustabout on different steamboats an' cotton picker. I worked on de
May Boyd
,
Lula D.
an' de
Gardner
. One of de ole songs sang on de
boats went somp'n lak dis:
De John T. Moore
De Lula D.
An' all dem boats is mine
If you can't ship on de Lula D.
You ain't no man o' mine.
""I been ma'ied three times, Mistis, an' Lawd chile I done forgot de name
of my fust wife. I guess she still livin' somewhere caze she was too
mean to die. My secon' wife was named Dora, an' she is daid. I got a
wife now name Lily. She purty good.
""Yes maam you can take my picture, but lemme git my hat, caze I ain't
got no hair on my haid, an' I looks better wid a hat. I'se got to be
fixed up stylish.""","Interview with Isaam Morgan

Interview with Nicey Pugh

Ila B. Prine, [HW: Mobile]
""When I was a little pickaninny I worked in Massa Jim's house,
sweepin' an' a-cleanin'. Us slaves had to be up at de house by sunup,
build de fires an' git de cookin' started. Dey had big open fireplaces
wid potracks to hang de pot on. Dat's whar us boiled de vegetables. An'
honey, us sho had plenty somp'n' t'eat: greens, taters, peas, rosenyurs
an' plenty of home killed meat. Sometimes my oldest brother, Joe West,
an' Friday Davis, anudder nigger, went huntin' at night an' kotched mo'
possums dan we could eat. Dey'd ketch lots of fish; 'nuf to las' us
three days.
""I remembers one day when me an' anudder little nigger gal was agoin'
atter de cows down in de fiel' an' us seed whut I reckon' was de Ku Klux
Klan. Us was so skeered us didn't know whut to do. One of 'em walked up
to us an' say: 'Niggers, whar you agoin'?'
""'Us is jus' atter de cows, Mr. Ku Klux,' us say. 'Us ain't up to no
debilment.'
""'All right den,' dey say, 'jus' you be sho dat you don't git up to
none.'
""Atter we got home us told de massa 'bout de 'sperience, an' he jus'
laugh. He tol' us dat we warn't goin' to be hurt iffen we was good; he
say dat it was only de bad niggers dat was goin' to be got atter by dem
Ku Klux.
""When we was little we didn't hab no games to play, kaze Massa Jim an'
Miss Marfa didn't hab no chilluns, an' I ain't neber had no speriences
wid ha'nts or hoodoos. Dey neber teach us to read or write kaze when de
niggers learn anything, dey would git upitty an' want to run away. We
would hab Sad'day afternoons off, den us would sweep de yards, an' set
aroun' on benches an' talk. It was on de benches dat mos' of us slaves
set in warm weather. We et outen tin cups an' us used iron spoons to
shovel de food in.
""At Christmas time, Massa would have a bunch of niggers to kill a hog
an' barbecue him, an' de womens would make 'lasses cake, an' ole massa
Jim had some kinda seed dat he made beer outen, an' we-alls drank beer
'roun' Christmas.
""But dere warn't no udder time such as New Years. Us all celebrated in a
big way den. Most of dem no 'count niggers stayed drunk fo' three days.
""An' as fo' de funerals, I don't eber remember but three white folks
dyin'. Dey jus' didn't seem to die in dem days, an' de ones dat did die
was mostly kilt by somp'n'. One white gentman got hisself kilt in a gin
'chinery an' anudder was kilt a workin' on de big road. Den dere was a
white 'oman who was kilt by a nigger boy kaze she beat him for sicking a
dog on a fine milk cow. He was de meanest nigger boy I eber seed. I'll
neber forgits de way dem white mens treated him atter he done had his
trial. Dey drug him through de town behin' a hoss, an' made him walk
ober sharp stones wid his bare feets, dat bled lak somebody done cut 'em
wid a knife. Dey neber gib him no water all dat day an' kep' him out in
de boilin' sun till dey got ready to hang him. When dey got ready to
hang him dey put him up on a stand and chunked rocks at his naked body;
dey thro gravel in his eyes and broke his ribs wid big rocks. Den dey
put a rope around his neck an' strung him up till his eyes pop outen his
head. I knowed it was a blessin' to him to die.
""But all and all, white folks, den was de really happy days for us
niggers. Course we didn't hab de 'vantages dat we has now, but dere wus
somp'n' back dere dat we ain't got now, an' dat's secu'aty. Yassuh, we
had somebody to go to when we was in trouble. We had a Massa dat would
fight fo' us an' help us an' laugh wid us an' cry wid us. We had a
Mistis dat would nuss us when we was sick, an' comfort us when we hadda
be punished. I sometimes wish I could be back on de ole place. I kin see
de cool-house now packed wid fresh butter an' milk an' cream. I can see
de spring down amongst de willows an' de water a trickling down between
little rocks. I can hear de turkeys a gobblin' in de yard and de
chickens a runnin' aroun' in de sun, an' shufflin' in de dus'. I can see
de bend in de creek jus' below our house, an' de cows as dey come to
drink in de shallow water an' gits dere feets cool.
Nicey Pugh, Prichard, Alabama
""Yassuh, white folks, you ain't neber seed nothin' lak it so you can't
tell de joy you gits f'um lookin' for dewberries an' a-huntin' guinea
pigs, an' settin' in de shade of a peach tree, reachin' up an' pullin'
off a ripe peach and eatin' it slow. You ain't neber seed your people
gathered 'bout an' singin' in de moonlight or heered de lark at de break
of day. You ain't neber walked acrost a frosty fiel' in de early
mornin', an' gone to de big house to build a fire for your Mistis, an'
when she wake up slow have her say to you: 'Well, how's my little nigger
today?'
""Nawsuh, jus' lak I told you at fus'. I was bawn a slave, but I ain't
neber been one. I'se been a worker for good peoples. You wouldn't calls
dat bein' a slave would you, white folks?""","Interview with Nicey Pugh

Interview with Nicey Pugh

Ila B. Prine, [HW: Mobile]
""When I was a little pickaninny I worked in Massa Jim's house,
sweepin' an' a-cleanin'. Us slaves had to be up at de house by sunup,
build de fires an' git de cookin' started. Dey had big open fireplaces
wid potracks to hang de pot on. Dat's whar us boiled de vegetables. An'
honey, us sho had plenty somp'n' t'eat: greens, taters, peas, rosenyurs
an' plenty of home killed meat. Sometimes my oldest brother, Joe West,
an' Friday Davis, anudder nigger, went huntin' at night an' kotched mo'
possums dan we could eat. Dey'd ketch lots of fish; 'nuf to las' us
three days.
""I remembers one day when me an' anudder little nigger gal was agoin'
atter de cows down in de fiel' an' us seed whut I reckon' was de Ku Klux
Klan. Us was so skeered us didn't know whut to do. One of 'em walked up
to us an' say: 'Niggers, whar you agoin'?'
""'Us is jus' atter de cows, Mr. Ku Klux,' us say. 'Us ain't up to no
debilment.'
""'All right den,' dey say, 'jus' you be sho dat you don't git up to
none.'
""Atter we got home us told de massa 'bout de 'sperience, an' he jus'
laugh. He tol' us dat we warn't goin' to be hurt iffen we was good; he
say dat it was only de bad niggers dat was goin' to be got atter by dem
Ku Klux.
""When we was little we didn't hab no games to play, kaze Massa Jim an'
Miss Marfa didn't hab no chilluns, an' I ain't neber had no speriences
wid ha'nts or hoodoos. Dey neber teach us to read or write kaze when de
niggers learn anything, dey would git upitty an' want to run away. We
would hab Sad'day afternoons off, den us would sweep de yards, an' set
aroun' on benches an' talk. It was on de benches dat mos' of us slaves
set in warm weather. We et outen tin cups an' us used iron spoons to
shovel de food in.
""At Christmas time, Massa would have a bunch of niggers to kill a hog
an' barbecue him, an' de womens would make 'lasses cake, an' ole massa
Jim had some kinda seed dat he made beer outen, an' we-alls drank beer
'roun' Christmas.
""But dere warn't no udder time such as New Years. Us all celebrated in a
big way den. Most of dem no 'count niggers stayed drunk fo' three days.
""An' as fo' de funerals, I don't eber remember but three white folks
dyin'. Dey jus' didn't seem to die in dem days, an' de ones dat did die
was mostly kilt by somp'n'. One white gentman got hisself kilt in a gin
'chinery an' anudder was kilt a workin' on de big road. Den dere was a
white 'oman who was kilt by a nigger boy kaze she beat him for sicking a
dog on a fine milk cow. He was de meanest nigger boy I eber seed. I'll
neber forgits de way dem white mens treated him atter he done had his
trial. Dey drug him through de town behin' a hoss, an' made him walk
ober sharp stones wid his bare feets, dat bled lak somebody done cut 'em
wid a knife. Dey neber gib him no water all dat day an' kep' him out in
de boilin' sun till dey got ready to hang him. When dey got ready to
hang him dey put him up on a stand and chunked rocks at his naked body;
dey thro gravel in his eyes and broke his ribs wid big rocks. Den dey
put a rope around his neck an' strung him up till his eyes pop outen his
head. I knowed it was a blessin' to him to die.
""But all and all, white folks, den was de really happy days for us
niggers. Course we didn't hab de 'vantages dat we has now, but dere wus
somp'n' back dere dat we ain't got now, an' dat's secu'aty. Yassuh, we
had somebody to go to when we was in trouble. We had a Massa dat would
fight fo' us an' help us an' laugh wid us an' cry wid us. We had a
Mistis dat would nuss us when we was sick, an' comfort us when we hadda
be punished. I sometimes wish I could be back on de ole place. I kin see
de cool-house now packed wid fresh butter an' milk an' cream. I can see
de spring down amongst de willows an' de water a trickling down between
little rocks. I can hear de turkeys a gobblin' in de yard and de
chickens a runnin' aroun' in de sun, an' shufflin' in de dus'. I can see
de bend in de creek jus' below our house, an' de cows as dey come to
drink in de shallow water an' gits dere feets cool.
Nicey Pugh, Prichard, Alabama
""Yassuh, white folks, you ain't neber seed nothin' lak it so you can't
tell de joy you gits f'um lookin' for dewberries an' a-huntin' guinea
pigs, an' settin' in de shade of a peach tree, reachin' up an' pullin'
off a ripe peach and eatin' it slow. You ain't neber seed your people
gathered 'bout an' singin' in de moonlight or heered de lark at de break
of day. You ain't neber walked acrost a frosty fiel' in de early
mornin', an' gone to de big house to build a fire for your Mistis, an'
when she wake up slow have her say to you: 'Well, how's my little nigger
today?'
""Nawsuh, jus' lak I told you at fus'. I was bawn a slave, but I ain't
neber been one. I'se been a worker for good peoples. You wouldn't calls
dat bein' a slave would you, white folks?""","Interview with Nicey Pugh

Personal interview with ""Aunt Annie"" Stanton
Rylands Lane, Mobile, Alabama

Ila B. Prine, Mobile, Alabama
""Aunt Annie"" says that things that happened when she was a child are
much more vivid in her mind than are things of today. She said ""Sumtimes
I now starts tuh do dumpin' an' fogits what I wants tuh do, den I ahs
tuh go bac' tuh de place whar I started from so I kin 'member whats I
started tuh do"".
""Aunt Annie"" was born on Knight's Place on the Alabama River, June 2nd.,
1853. This place is now known as Finchburg, in Monroe County, Alabama.
Her mother's name was Mary Knight and her father's name was Atlas
Williams, who had the same name as his owner, Mr. Offord Williams. ""Aunt
Annie's"" mother's people were owned first by Mr. Cullen Knight and after
his death, were owned by Mr. John Marshall.
""Aunt Annie"" was seven years old then the Civil War started, and that
she had ""nursed two cullered chillun afore de war.""
When asked by the writer about nursing these children, so as to be sure
she said colored children, she replied, ""dat de slaves lived on de
plantation, and dey had an overseer who libed on dis place, an' she
neber seed de Marshall's place 'til after dey was freed. As I growed
bigger into a big yearlin' gal I was tuk intuh de oversee'rs home to
'tend tuh de dinin' room table sich as settin' hit an' washin' de dishes
an' cleanin' up, an' later on I was showed how to iron, spin thread,
weave cloth, and make candles. Honey, folks talkin' 'bout depression now
don't kno' nothin' 'bout hard times. In dem days folks didn't hab
nothin' 'ceptin' what dey made. Eben if yo' had a mint ob money, dere
was nothin' to buy. We made de candles to burn by tying strings on the
stick and puttin' dem down in melted tallow in moulds. In dem times we
had no matches, folks made fire by strikin' flint rocks together an' de
fire droppin' on cotton. I don't know whether dese rocks were ones dat
de Indians lef' or no, but day was dif'rent from other rocks. People
usta carry dem an' de cotton roun' in boxes sumtin lak snuff boxes tuh
keep de cotton dry. Sumtimes when dey could'nt get de fire no odder way,
dey would put de cotton in de fireplace and shoot up in dere an' set hit
on fire.""
""Aunt Annie"" said she never could start a fire with the flint rock and
cotton, and she said, ""de fust matches and lantern I'se eber seed was
when de Yankees cum tuh dere place, I th'ot dey was two officers, 'couse
dey had de matches and lantern. Two years a'ter I was freed, an' twar
den I seed mah first lamp.
""De men did mos' ob de farm wurk, dey planted cotton, corn, potatoes,
cane, peas and pumpkins, an' dey ginned de cotton by hitching four
horses tuh de gin, and dey run hit dat way.""
When asked if they had plenty to eat when they were slaves, ""Aunt Annie""
said:
""Lor', yes I guess we had 'nough, but, 'tearn't much, c'ase I 'members
when we was li'l chillun we had a big wooden tray dat dey put de food in
and we all set 'round dat an' et like li'l pigs. De rations for a week

""Aunt Annie"" says that things that happened when she was a child are
much more vivid in her mind than are things of today. She said ""Sumtimes
I now starts tuh do dumpin' an' fogits what I wants tuh do, den I ahs
tuh go bac' tuh de place whar I started from so I kin 'member whats I
started tuh do"".
""Aunt Annie"" was born on Knight's Place on the Alabama River, June 2nd.,
1853. This place is now known as Finchburg, in Monroe County, Alabama.
Her mother's name was Mary Knight and her father's name was Atlas
Williams, who had the same name as his owner, Mr. Offord Williams. ""Aunt
Annie's"" mother's people were owned first by Mr. Cullen Knight and after
his death, were owned by Mr. John Marshall.
""Aunt Annie"" was seven years old then the Civil War started, and that
she had ""nursed two cullered chillun afore de war.""
When asked by the writer about nursing these children, so as to be sure
she said colored children, she replied, ""dat de slaves lived on de
plantation, and dey had an overseer who libed on dis place, an' she
neber seed de Marshall's place 'til after dey was freed. As I growed
bigger into a big yearlin' gal I was tuk intuh de oversee'rs home to
'tend tuh de dinin' room table sich as settin' hit an' washin' de dishes
an' cleanin' up, an' later on I was showed how to iron, spin thread,
weave cloth, and make candles. Honey, folks talkin' 'bout depression now
don't kno' nothin' 'bout hard times. In dem days folks didn't hab
nothin' 'ceptin' what dey made. Eben if yo' had a mint ob money, dere
was nothin' to buy. We made de candles to burn by tying strings on the
stick and puttin' dem down in melted tallow in moulds. In dem times we
had no matches, folks made fire by strikin' flint rocks together an' de
fire droppin' on cotton. I don't know whether dese rocks were ones dat
de Indians lef' or no, but day was dif'rent from other rocks. People
usta carry dem an' de cotton roun' in boxes sumtin lak snuff boxes tuh
keep de cotton dry. Sumtimes when dey could'nt get de fire no odder way,
dey would put de cotton in de fireplace and shoot up in dere an' set hit
on fire.""
""Aunt Annie"" said she never could start a fire with the flint rock and
cotton, and she said, ""de fust matches and lantern I'se eber seed was
when de Yankees cum tuh dere place, I th'ot dey was two officers, 'couse
dey had de matches and lantern. Two years a'ter I was freed, an' twar
den I seed mah first lamp.
""De men did mos' ob de farm wurk, dey planted cotton, corn, potatoes,
cane, peas and pumpkins, an' dey ginned de cotton by hitching four
horses tuh de gin, and dey run hit dat way.""
When asked if they had plenty to eat when they were slaves, ""Aunt Annie""
said:
""Lor', yes I guess we had 'nough, but, 'tearn't much, c'ase I 'members
when we was li'l chillun we had a big wooden tray dat dey put de food in
and we all set 'round dat an' et like li'l pigs. De rations for a week
was 3 lbs of meat a week, 1 peck ob meal, potatoes an' syrup. At
Christmas times de overseer called all de men an' women in an' gib each
woman a dress, a head handkerchief, an' tuh de men he gave a hat, knife,
an' a bottle of whiskey. De overseer also gib tuh us flour and sugar fo'
Christmas, an' I 'members one Christmas when I was a li'l gal, a'ter de
overseer gib all de women a dress dere was a short piece ob cloth lef'
an' he gib dat tuh me."" ""Aunt Annie"" said ""dat de slaves went tuh de
white folks church, an' sot on de seats on de outside ob de church, an'
dat church was a hewed log building. Atter de white folks got thro'
preachin', den de cullered preacher would preach. Sumtimes de cullered
folks would hab church when de white folks didn't an' den de slaves
would hab tuh get a pass from his owner, 'ca'se dere would be some mean
folks what would beat de niggers ef dey didn't hab a pass from dere
owners or bosses.""
""Aunt Annie"" also said, ""I'se neber hyeard of no hoodoo stuff 'til in
late years, dey's mo' ob dat foolishness now dan I'se ebber hyeard of in
mah life. Nowadays de hoodoos doctors, what is allus agoin' 'round
foolin' folks out ob dey money, looks lack de dogs might ob and' dem,
dey is so turrible lookin'. I don't believes in dem. Us folks a long
time ago neber hab no money fo' dem to git. Us had tuh make own
medicine. When de babies had de colic us wud tie soot up in a rag an'
boil it, and den gib dem de water, an' tuh ease de prickly heat us used
cotton wood powdered up fine, and fo' de yellow thrash us would boil de
sheep thrash an' gib em de tea.""
""Aunt Annie"" has been married twice, her first husband left her years
ago, when she married Louis Stanton and had five children by him. Louis
was killed in a hailstorm, April 13, 1903, and all of her children are
dead. She is now being cared for by friends, and she said, ""that ef I's
didn't git a li'l he'p from de Government tuh gib dis frien'"" she didn't
know what she would do as she has been totally blind for two years.","Personal interview with ""Aunt Annie"" Stanton

Personal interview with Cull Taylor

A tall, stoop-shouldered, black Negro man came trudging down the road
with a hoe in his hand. Asked where Cull Taylor lived, the old man said,
""Lady I'se Cull Taylor. Dis is mah house here. Does you want to see me?""
When told that his visitor was looking for old people who lived during
slavery days Cull said:
""I were born a slave, but warn't very old when de niggers was freed. I
were born March 5, 1859, in Augusta County, Alabama. Mah maw come from
Richmond, Virginia and her name were Jane Hare. Mah paw's name were
Willingham Hare, and he were brought to Alabama from North Carolina. I
guess you'se wonderin' why mah name is Taylor when mah maws and paws
name was Hare?
""You see when dey was fust brought here, a man name Tom Taylor bought
'em, an' when I were born, dey gib me to Miss Bennie Taylor. Ol' Marse
Tom's girl. Miss Bennie gib me de name Taylor an' I'se allus kept hit.
She shorely was good to me. I neber had nothing much to do, I stayed wid
her, 'til I was grown, atter she married Mr. Bob Alexander.
""'Bout de war, I does 'member how mah maw was a-weavin' cloth when de
Yankees come through. An' atter de niggers was freed ol' Marse Tom gib
mah maw de loom.
""Ol' Marse was a good man. He neber 'lowed no o'seer or anybody to
mistreat his niggers. He had plenty of 'em, too, and a big plantation
wid plenty to eat. Course de slaves had to work on de plantation an'
raise de stuff to eat. His house was a big fine, white place, an' de
cabins whar de slaves libed was built in rows, wid streets between dem,
so you could drive 'tween 'em wid big double team wagons. De cabins was
built out ob logs wid a notch out in de shoulders, an' laid on top ob
one another an' when dey built de wall up as high as dey wanted hit, dey
would bore a augor hole an' put a pin in hit to hold 'em together. Den
dey put de roof on. Dey filled de cracks between de logs wid mortar, so
as to keep de wind out, an' it sho' made de houses warm. Us had jes'
wooden home-made beds, wid mattresses made of cotton, or moss, an'
sometimes hay. Us neber hab no springs on de beds.
""As I said, Ol' Marse Tom was a good man, an' he was too old to go to de
war, but he had two boys. De oldest one went to de war an' was killed.
But de youngest warn't old enough to go. Ol' Marse Tom had de women sew,
makin' clothes, an' had nurse women to look atter de little niggers
while dere maws was in de fields. I 'members as a li'l boy how dey had
one house whar de nurse kept de chillun an' it was as clean as a pin.
Dere was wooden troughs different heights for de different age chillun,
an' dose troughs was scrubbed as white as cotton mos'. When meal time
come, dey would crumble up cornbread wid pot licker, or milk an' gib to
de youngest ones. An' dey had plenty ob milk, I 'members de big milk
dairy, an' smoke house on de place, an' when de Yankees come through dey
went into de dairy an' drank all de milk dey wanted.
""I 'members mah paw was out in de woods hidin' de mules when dey come
through an' dere was only one old horse on de place. Dem Yankees turn
hit loose, but otherwise dey behaved very nice.""
Cull said that they didn't know anything about dishes and spoons such as
are used now, for they had wooden spoons for the slaves. He said that
the usual rations for a week included a peck of meal, and six or seven
pounds of meat to each man, and if he had a big family he was given
more. They raised rice, sugar cane, pumpkins, watermelons, cushaws,
peaches, pears, plums and grapes.
""Mah white folks not only tuk keer ob us durin' slavery times, but dey
gib us things atter us was freed. You ax me 'bout de slaves clothes?
Yas'm, lady, us had good, stout, clothes, made out ob de cloth dat de
women wove. I can see mah maw throwing dat ol' shickle from one side to
de other, weaving cloth on dat loom. Dey dyed de cloth wid red oaks an'
dogwood bark, and Chinaberry bark, and had all kinds ob colors, sich as
blue, red, brown, and black.
""Den dere was de big times, sich as de hog killin' time, an' corn
shucking, an' 'specially cotton pickin' time. Sometimes de neighboring
plantation would hab a regular cotton pickin' festival, an' all ob us
would go and he'p pick de cotton, and de nigger what would pick de mos'
would git a dress or de men would git a suit ob clothes. De suits was
made out ob osnaburg, and sometimes bed tickin'. When a big crowd would
come to dese cotton pickin's, dey would pick out three or four bales ob
cotton.
""De li'l niggers had a good time playin' in de sand makin' frog houses,
an' spinnin' tops. But, Lordy! when us got sick, dey gib us Jerusalem
oak and sassafras tea. But neber was dere anything said 'bout hoo-doo
stuf. I never heard ob hit, 'til dese later years.
""But us did hab church, an' prayer meetin', an' funerals! Lor', yes, dey
don't bury folks now. In dose days dey started singin' at de house an'
sung all de way to de graveyard; an' den dey put dem in de groun' good
full six feet deep, dey jes' lays folks on top ob de groun' now-a-days.
But times is different now, lady.
""I 'members how de men would go out nights an' hunt de possums an' de
coons, and wild cats. Dey den would sometimes go deer an' rabbit huntin'
in de daytime; an', too, dey would set traps to ketch other varmints.
Dere was plenty ob squirrels too.
""But let me tell you, de bes' thing ob all, was de good locust beer, dey
made from locust seeds. Dey also made 'simmon beer, an' wine out ob
plums. Dem war good days den.""","Personal interview with Cull Taylor

Personal interview with George Taylor
409 South Hamilton Street, Mobile, Alabama

Ila B. Prine, Mobile, Alabama
George Taylor, an old and very black man, who lives at 409 South
Hamilton street in Mobile, says he is an ex-slave. He knows that he was
born in Mobile on the corner of Cedar and Texas streets, but left
Mobile, and was carried to Gosport, Alabama, when he was twelve years
old. His father's name was Gus Taylor and his mother's Sarah Taylor, and
they were owned by Mr. W.G. Herrin. There were twenty-one children in
George's family, and he said he was the oldest one, and helped ""nuss de
odders.""
""Mah grandfather's name was Mac Wilson an' mah grandmother's name was
Ellen Wilson, an' de ol' Miss's name was Miss Mamie Herrin. All de
colored folks' chillun called Mr. Herrin 'Cl' Marster, an' he sho' was a
good marster, too. I 'members dat atter I got to be a big boy dey put me
in de fiel's choppin' cotton, but I neber could pick cotton. I knows dat
mah paw said I was too crazy 'bout de girls, so he tuk me an' made me
plow.
""Ol' marster had a big place, I don't jes' exactly knows how many acres
dey was, but I knows us had plenty ob cotton, 'ca'se sometimes dey would
pick four or five bales a day. An' den I knows durin' cotton time mah
paw hauled cotton all day long to de gin whut was run by five or six
mules.
""Durin' de busy season on de plantation ol' Marster had de older women
cookin' an' sendin' de dinner to de fiel'. Dere was two big baskets, one
to put de bread in, an' de odder basket to put de meat in. Every mornin'
at three o'clock de women begun cookin' an' each han' brought his own
meat an' bread to this cabin to be cooked. Every person's plate had
their names on 'em. Ever'body had to be up by daylight an' ready to
begin work. De men had to get up before daylight an' begin to harness
de mules, an' soon as light dey was in de fiel's. Dere was two hundred
and fifty head ob colored people, 'scusing chillun. Dey would raise
four, five, and six hundred bales ob cotton, a year. Us worked den, dere
warn't no walkin' 'bout den, not eben on Sat'day atternoons, but I
believes I'd lack it betta dan I does now, 'cause de chillun was taught
to be mannerable den, but now dey cuss if you say anything to dem.
""Us had a good place to stay, de ol' Marster's house was a big two-story
house, an' our cabins was built ob boards an' was in a row. Us didn't
hab no stoves, jes' cooked out in de yard ober a fire wid stakes on each
side of hit, wid an' iron bar across 'em to hang de pots on. Ol' Marster
rationed out de food, an' each man was 'lowed seven pounds ob meat, de
women was 'lowed six pounds an' five pounds for each child. Den dey gib
us a peck ob meal, five pounds of flour and some molasses.
""I neber did eat at home wid mah folks, 'ca'se I nussed in de big house,
an' ebery time dat de white chillun eat, I had to eat, too. Dere was
plenty ob pecan, walnut, an' ches'nut trees on de place, an' us could
eat all de nuts we wanted; and den de slaves had dere own gardens if dey
wanted to.
""Den I 'members how dere was four men who put de hogs in de pens to
fatten, sometimes, dey would put as many as a hundred or a hundred an'
fifty at a time. Den hit was dere duty to tote feed from de fiel's to
feed 'em.
""My! when I think ob dat big smoke house, mah mouth jes' waters. At hog
killin' time, dere was certain men to kill, an' certain ones to cut 'em
up. Dere warn't neber no special time to hog killin', jes' when de ol'
Marster said do hit, we did hit.
""You see us was allus under his direction, 'ca'se if us wanted to go
anywhere, us had to git a pass, eben to church. De white folks had
Methodist church, an' de collored had de Baptist church.
""I also 'members de time I was put up on de block to be sold, an' when
de man only offered five hundred dollars, fer me, an' Ol' Marster tole
me to git down, dat I was de mos' valuable nigger he had, 'ca'se I was
so strong, an' could do so muck work.
""Mah maw was de weaver, an' dere was a woman named Assella who did de
dyeing. Mah paw gathered de bark, sich as red oak, elm, maple and
juniper bark, an' dry hit an' den grin' hit up. Dey also used borax,
alum and blue stone, to set de dye. De women made de clothes out ob dis
cloth dat was woven on de place.
""You axed 'bout weddin's. Us didn't hab weddin's lack us do now. De way
us married would be to go to de big house, an' ol' Marster had us to
jump over a broom stick, an' den us was considered married. But dere was
one thing dat us warn't 'lowed to do, an' dat was to abuse or cuss our
wives, an' you betta not strike 'em, ca'se hit would be jes' too bad.
""You know, Miss, I'se been here a long time. I 'members when dere was
only one house 'tween St. Louis Street an' Frascati, an' dat was de
Guard House. I also 'members de ole time remedies dat dey used in de ole
days. Dey used red oak bark for fever an' colds, an' den dere was
hoarhound, an' black snake root dat de ol' Marster put whiskey on. Ol'
Marster made his own whiskey. An' oh! yes, de calomus root growed in de
woods whar dey lived. I neber seed dem send to no store for medicine. I
neber hyeard ob no hoodoo stuff, 'till I was grown, an' anudder thing
folks didn't die of lack dey do now. When any one did die, dey allus had
a big funeral, an' de men would sometimes hitch up a ox team or mule
teams, an' as many as could git in would go. De coffins was home made
an' stained. Dere was plenty ob han's to dig de graves, too.
""I'se tell you, Miss, folks is pretty much de same, if de white folks
treat de niggers right, you couldn't get dem to leave dem. I 'members
when de Yankees come through, I was standin' on de Ol' Marster's porch,
an' I seed dem comming, an' Marster got up on his crutch an' go to de
steps an' invite dem in, an' believe me dey come in, too. Dey jes'
natcherly tore up ol' Marster's place; then de furniture all 'roun' an'
broke heaps ob hit. I knows b'fore dey got dere ol' Marster had mah paw,
an' Jerry Lee, an' Mace Pouncey, an' anudder man take four barrels ob
money an' carry down to de spring an' put hit in de spring, an' I'se
tellin' you, Miss, you couldn't any more git near dat spring, dan
nothin', ca'se de quicksan' made dem barrels boil up, one at a time, an'
de way dey had to git dem barrels, was to buil' a scaffold from de
river, an' let a line down an' ketch aroun' dem barrels.
""Atter we was freed, Ol' Marster come out in de yard an' got in de
middle ob all ob us, an' tole us dat de ones dat wants to stay wid him,
to stan' on one side, an' de odders to stan' on de odder side. So mah
paw got on de side wid dose who wanted to leave, an' us lef' Ol' Marster
an' paddled down de river, in a paddlin' boat to Belle's Landing.
""As I'se said before, I'se been here a long time, I eben 'members seeing
Jeff Davis. I knows I ain't here for long, but I'se ready, 'ca'se I'se
been fightin' for Jesus twenty-nine years, an' I ain't tired ob fightin'
yet. I'se a Deacon in de Baptist Church.""","Personal interview with George Taylor

Interview with Ellen Thomas
-
Mary A. Poole, Mobile
In a little cottage at 310 Wienacker Avenue, in the western part of
Mobile, lives Ellen Thomas, who claims to be 89 years old. She is small
of stature, dark brown in color, with high cheek bones and small regular
features. Although she wears the old-fashioned bandana handkerchief
bound about her head, the story of 'Aunt' Ellen is unusual, in that
having been raised as a house servant in a cultured Southern family, she
absorbed or was trained in the use of correct speech, and does not
employ the dialect common to Negroes of the slavery days.
'Aunt' Ellen was born in Mobile. Her mother, Emeline, was a dwarf who
was brought from St. Louis to Mobile by a slave-trader. When put up for
sale, her deformity enlisted the sympathy of Judge F.G. Kimball, who
bought her and brought her to his home on Dauphin Street, between
Hallett Street and Georgia Avenue. Later, Sam Brown, a free Negro from
the West Indies, came to Mobile and, wanting Emeline for his wife,
agreed to pay Judge Kimball for her, giving himself as security. Sam and
Emeline had only two children, Pedro and Ellen, both born on Judge
Kimball's place and raised in his home as house servants, having little
contact with the field slaves.
In her childhood, Ellen had as her special mistress Miss Cornelia, one
of the Kimball girls, who trained her in the arts of good housekeeping,
including fine sewing, which was itself an art among the women of that
period. Ellen relates with much pride, her ability to put in tucks and
back-stitch them in the front of men's shirts, to equal the best machine
work of the present day. Although hampered by failing eyesight in recent
years, her work with the needle today is proof that her claims are not
exaggerated.
In all her experience as a slave, she recalls but one whipping. This was
with a small switch in the hands of Judge Kimball. The cause? She
answered: ""I ain't coming,"" when he called her; and at his second call,
she said: ""I shan't do it."" She was seven years old at the time.
Judge Kimball insisted that the house servants use good English, she
said. Thus brought up as a child among the Kimball children, and because
of her duties as a house servant, she mingled little with the field
hands and acquired none of their dialect. Even her long association with
free Negroes since the war, has failed to eradicate early impressions
and practices in the use of words, and she stresses this in conversation
with educated white persons.
Because she was a house servant, Ellen was accorded many privileges not
enjoyed by ordinary slaves. Good food, neat clothing and cleanliness of
person were requirements rigidly enforced. As personal maid to young
girls little older than herself, her lot was quiet and the association
developed a devotion and friendship that was lifelong. Among the
privileges that fell to her as a child, she recalls that of accompanying
the family on carriage rides-usually seated beside the driver to the
envy of her little mistress on the more dignified inside seat.
Ellen Thomas, Mobile, Alabama
Her training as a house servant was very broad and involved every
feature of a well kept household of that period. She has especial pride
in her ability to serve at table, particularly when there were guests
present. A feature of the training given her and which Ellen says she
never knew of anyone else receiving was, after being taught to set the
dining table complete for guests, she would be blindfolded and then told
to go through the motions of serving and so learn to do so without
disturbing anything on the table. So proficient did she become in
serving, that a few times when they had guests, Judge Kimball would for
their amusement have Ellen blindfolded and direct her to serve the
dinner. In passing dishes a small silver tray was used.
Ellen said that they tried to teach her brother Pedro to serve the table
likewise; but his natural clumsiness prevented. He could never learn.
During the war, she said, her master had an immense pit dug near the
house, put his cotton in the pit and built the woodpile over it. The
Federal invaders never found it.
Judge Kimball owned extensive tracts of land above Mobile and used a
large number of his slaves to cut timber for wood and lumber; hewn
timber being largely used for house-building. He built a house for every
one of his children, from his own timber, and even had his own coffin
made from home-grown cedar. Ellen failed to follow this act of her
master with approval, judging from her tone in speaking of it.
She remembers the Surrender and the incidents accompanying that event.
She was seventeen years old. Thus she describes the first visit
afterward of the enemy. ""I was helping to cook breakfast one morning,
frying codfish and potatoes, when I heard a drum and ran to tell Master.
He jumped up and said: 'It's the Yankees! Tell Pedro to get a sheet and
hang it out in front.' Pedro was excited and, instead of getting a
sheet, got one of Mistress' best table cloths and hung it from a big oak
tree near the front gate. When the Yankees rode up, they dismounted and
Master invited them in for breakfast.""
One of the Yankee Lieutenants asked her name, and she told him: ""Ellen
Brown."" He looked puzzled at her answer, knowing her master's name to be
Kimball. (Since her father was a free man, 'Aunt' Ellen said that she
and her brother, Pedro, always retained their own name, instead of
""Kimball."") The lieutenant then said: ""All right, Ellen, bring me a
glass of milk at thirteen o'clock.""
She went to her little mistress, and asked her ""what that old lieutenant
meant by 'thirteen o'clock.'"" Miss Cornelia laughed and said he meant
""one o'clock.""
'Aunt' Ellen related how Judge Kimball was always teaching them and gave
them regular lectures. She particularly remembers one of his sayings:
""You can never swing on yellow pine tree, as it is tender and pliable.""
She remained with the Kimballs three years after the war, worked for
other families a short time and then married Amos Thomas when she was
about twenty years old. They had a very large family, eleven girls and
nine boys. She now has great-grandchildren who are married.
Although there is little doubt that her age is approximately what she
claims, 'Aunt' Ellen is remarkably well preserved, physically and
mentally. Her activity and industry would not be inappropriate to a
woman a score of years younger. Unlike many persons of her years she
does not constantly look forward to her time of departure, but takes
life as it comes-caring more for today than for tomorrow.","Interview with Ellen Thomas

Interview with Oliver Bell
-
Ruby Pickens Tartt, Livingston
Oliver Bell says the first thing he remembers was seeing his mother
whipped. He was born in slavery, but most of his knowledge of the evils,
as well as the joys of ante-bellum days, is by hearsay only.
""I was borned on de De Graffenreid Place,"" he said, ""nine miles west of
Livingston-Boyd Road. My mother was Luella De Graffenreid an' my pappy
was Edmund De Graffenreid. Den dey changed my name to Bell. I had one
brother, Nat, an' two sisters, Jestina an' Clara. I has 'bout sixteen
chilluns, all born on de same place an' most of dem is livin' dere yit.
My chillun by my firs' wife are Ed, Jack, Holly, Buck, Clarence, Sally,
Liza, Mag an' Luella. Dey ma was Mandy Powell, frum York. Den my second
wife, Bettie Brown, gived me de res' of my chilluns. Le's see, dey is
Jimmy, J.W. Alfonso Wallace, Henry, Edna an' --"" He hesitated,
explained, ""Dat's as many as I kin' 'member jest now.
Oliver Bell, Livingston, Alabama
""My gran'ma's name was Cely De Graffenreid an' my gran'pa's name
was Peter. He was a shoemaker fur de place an' made plows, too. He was
a worker an' he learnt me how to pull fodder an' chop corn an' cotton
when I was jest a little scamp jes' a little black nigger.
""Us all b'longed to Mr. Tresvan De Graffenreid an' Mistus Rebecca;
an' dey was all good to us. Ol' Mistus read de Bible to us an' got us
baptized in de river at Horn's bridge, but dat was atter de surrender. In
slavery times dey didn't like for us to sing an play loud in de quarters.
Honey, I 'members when us had de big prayer meetin's. Dey would shut de
door so de voice won't git out, an' dey would turn de washpot down de door.
Dat was to keep de voice inside, dey tol' me.""
Oliver mused a moment, recalling the old times.
""Us chilluns useta have a good time singin' an' a-playin',"" he
said. ""I 'members one of our little verses run somethin' lak dis:
Shoo, shoo, shoo gander
Th'ow yo' feathers 'way yander.
""Us had ol' corn hollers, too, but I fergits um now. I does remember
though you could hear dem niggers holler a whole mile.
""No'm, it warn't so bad wid us. De white folks was good to us niggers.
Us had 'nough to eat, lak greens, frum de big house. Us had our rations
weighted out; peck o' meal, three pounds of meat, half gallon of
'lasses, made at home in wodden mills; an' dat was for a week. An'
sometimes, on a Sunday us had a little sugar, coffee an' flour. No'm, us
didn't know what rice was.
""What I seed of slavery was a bad idea, I reckon, but ev'ybody thought
dey marster was de bes' in de lan'. Us didn't know no better. A man was
growed plum' green 'fo he knew de whole worl' didn't belong to his ol'
marster.
""Us didn't have no bought medicine in dem days; jes' whut us got outta
de woods lak slippery ellum fer fever an' poke salad root; dey he'p a
lot. An' May-apple root would he'p you same as castor oil.
""Didn't nobody he'p us learn nothin' much, but mos' of my chilluns went
to Booker T's school. Dey say he's a mighty smart man, an' my chilluns
thinks so, too. It's all right; I wish I could read an' write; den I'd
tell you things you'd lak to know.""
His face clouded for the briefest moment.
""I tell you de fust thing I 'members, an' I don't know whut started it.
One day my mammy done sumpin' an' ol' marster made her pull her dress
down 'roun' her waist an' made her lay down 'crost de door. Den he taken
a leather strop an' whooped her. I 'members dat I started cryin' an'
Mistus Beckie said, 'Go git dat boy a biskit.'
""I reckerlecks my mammy was a plow han' an' she'd go to work soon an'
put me under de shade of a big ol' post-oak tree. Dere I sat all day,
an' dat tree was my nurse. It still standin' dere yit, an' I won't let
nobody cut it down.
""Mammy say I never did learn to walk; jes' one day she sot me down under
de oak, an' fust thing she knowed she look up an' dere I was walkin'
down de middle of a cotton row.
""'Nother thing I 'members when I was a little boy; dat dey was 'vidin'
de corn atter de s'render. Dr. DeGraffenreid measured de corn out to all
of 'em whut was share han's. He'd take a bushel an' give 'em a bushel.
When he mos' through he'd throw a ear of corn to dis one, an' give
himse'f a ear; den he break a ear in two, an' he take part an' give dem
part. Dat was close measurin', I tell you.
""Us lived in de third house frum de big house in de quarter, an' when I
was a boy it was my job to set out shade trees. An' one day de Ku Klux
come ridin' by an' dey leader was Mister Steve Renfroe. (Alabama bandit
of Reconstruction days). He wore long hair an' he call my pappy out an'
ax him a heap of questions. While he sittin' dere his horse pull up nigh
'bout all de trees I done sot out.
""Atter talkin' to my pappy, he rode on 'cross Horn's bridge, 'bout two
miles souf of here, an' dere he met Ol' Man Enoch Sledge an' Frank
Sledge. Dey was darkies whut b'longed to Marsa Simmy Sledge's father,
Ol' Doctor Sledge. Slaves on dat plantation was 'lowed pretty good
privilege atter de s'rrender an' was workin' on halvens. Uncle Enoch an'
Frank was in town tradin' some, an' Mr. Renfroe didn't want 'em to have
anything. When dey lef' town, dey pass de Ku Kluxes raght on de slough
bridge. Mister Renfroe ax Enoch to give him a piece of string to fix his
saddle wid; den shot him. Frank run to de river, but de Ku Kluxes
cotched him an' shot him, too.
""De niggers went down to de river dat night an' got de bodies an' buried
'em in de ol' Travis graveyard. My mammy an' daddy is buried dere, too.
""Didn' nobody do nothin' 'bout Mister Renfroe 'till he went on an' got
to messin' wid Marsa Simmy Sledge's things; stole a pair of mules an' de
white folks rambled atter him 'till dey foun' him in Linden. Dey got so
hot atter him dat he went to his camp in de flat woods down on Bear
Creek. Dem was skeery times, 'case dat man never had no mercy for
nobody.
""Dey's a cave down by de burial grounds whut de slaves dug when dey run
away, an' Mister Renfroe stayed dere. It's on de river bank an' its dug
up. You digs an' starts low an' pushes de dirt out an' digs up an' makes
a big room up so de water won't git you. I knows whar dey's two of de
caves on de place; my cow fell in one yestidy.
""When Ol' Marster Amos Travis come out here from Californy, he taken a
lakin' to me an' wanted me to leave t'other side of de place an' move
down dis side of de big house to take keer of dis swamp an' look atter
de han's. But I wanted a big house wid four rooms an' two brick
chimneys, an' I had to talk five years to git it. I's got some
rosebushes now dat was at de big house raght atter de s'rrender, an'
dey's growin' in my yard now.
""Speakin' 'bout graveyard, I was passin' dere one night, ridin' on 'bout
midnight, an' sumpin' come draggin' a chain by me lak a dog. I got down
off'n my horse, but couldn't see nothin' wid no chain, so I got back on
de horse an' dere raght in front of me was a Jack-Me-Lantern wid de
brightes' light you ever seed. It was tryin' to lead me off, an' ev'y
time I'd git back in de road it would lead me off ag'in. You sho' will
git los' if you follow a Jack-Me-Lantern.
""One of dem led a man down to de creek by dem double bridges; said he
foun' he was travelin' in de wrong direction, gittin' frum home stidder
clo'ster, so he jes' sit down under a tree an' waited 'til daylight. I
ain't skeered of nothin' but dem Jack-Me-Lanterns, but dey stirs you up
in yo' min' till you can't tell whar you's at; an' dey's so bright dey
nigh 'bout puts yo' eyes out. Dey is plenty of 'em over by de graveyard
raght over yonder whar all my white folks is buried, an' mammy an'
pappy, too. Dey's all dere 'cept Marsa Jess Travis; he was de nex' whut
come in line for de place, an' he was de bes' frein' dis here nigger
ever had.
""Fac' was, dat's whut he call me; 't was 'nigger'. He an' Mistus Mag
lived raght dere in de big house; den dey move into town an' dat's whar
he died. Me an' Marsa Jess made a 'greement an' he said if he was de
longes' liver, he'd see me buried, an' if I be de longes' liver, I see
him buried. So dat day I went to his office in de co'thouse an' he say
he want to talk wid me. He say, 'You 'members us 'greement?' An' I say,
'Whut 'greement, Marsa Jess?' An' he say, 'Bout buryin'.' Den I say,
sho', 'I 'members dat.'
""Den he got up an' give me some papers 'bout some lan', an' I say, 'Whut
do all dis here mean, Marse Jess?' He say, 'nothin', nigger, 'cept I's
jes' goin' outta business.' Den I say, 'Goodbye, Marse Jess,' an' he
say, 'Goodbye, nigger,' an' I walked on 'crost de street. Den Mr.
Killian say, 'Oliver, whut's happened over at de co'thouse?' An I say,
'Ain't nothin' as I knows of.' Den he say, 'Yes, dey is; jes' look at de
peoples gwine in a hurry.' Den I turn 'roun' an' run back an' dere lay
Marse Jess. Mr. Smith was gettin' him up an' Marse Jess say to me,
'Well, nigger, I didn't do whut I tended to; I missed it.' An' I say,
'Boss, fer God's sake go to de hospital; I'll go wid you an' stay wid
you.' Mistus Mag, she ast me to beg him, but he shuck his head an' say
'If I had a-wanted to live I wouldn't of shot myself.' He res' a minit,
den say, 'Nigger, write Miss Calline an' tell her I says to always be
good to you as long as you lives.'
""Yassum, I was raght dere, done jes' whut I tol' him I'd do; kep' my
'greement an' followed him to de grave. Co'se dat last 'bout Marse Jess
ain't no slavery tale, but I thought you was atter hearin' all 'bout de
family whut owned dis ol' place; an' Marse Jess was de bes' white frein'
a nigger ever had; dis nigger, anyhow.""","Interview with Oliver Bell

Interview with Oliver Bell
-
Ruby Pickens Tartt, Livingston
Oliver Bell says the first thing he remembers was seeing his mother
whipped. He was born in slavery, but most of his knowledge of the evils,
as well as the joys of ante-bellum days, is by hearsay only.
""I was borned on de De Graffenreid Place,"" he said, ""nine miles west of
Livingston-Boyd Road. My mother was Luella De Graffenreid an' my pappy
was Edmund De Graffenreid. Den dey changed my name to Bell. I had one
brother, Nat, an' two sisters, Jestina an' Clara. I has 'bout sixteen
chilluns, all born on de same place an' most of dem is livin' dere yit.
My chillun by my firs' wife are Ed, Jack, Holly, Buck, Clarence, Sally,
Liza, Mag an' Luella. Dey ma was Mandy Powell, frum York. Den my second
wife, Bettie Brown, gived me de res' of my chilluns. Le's see, dey is
Jimmy, J.W. Alfonso Wallace, Henry, Edna an' --"" He hesitated,
explained, ""Dat's as many as I kin' 'member jest now.
Oliver Bell, Livingston, Alabama
""My gran'ma's name was Cely De Graffenreid an' my gran'pa's name
was Peter. He was a shoemaker fur de place an' made plows, too. He was
a worker an' he learnt me how to pull fodder an' chop corn an' cotton
when I was jest a little scamp jes' a little black nigger.
""Us all b'longed to Mr. Tresvan De Graffenreid an' Mistus Rebecca;
an' dey was all good to us. Ol' Mistus read de Bible to us an' got us
baptized in de river at Horn's bridge, but dat was atter de surrender. In
slavery times dey didn't like for us to sing an play loud in de quarters.
Honey, I 'members when us had de big prayer meetin's. Dey would shut de
door so de voice won't git out, an' dey would turn de washpot down de door.
Dat was to keep de voice inside, dey tol' me.""
Oliver mused a moment, recalling the old times.
""Us chilluns useta have a good time singin' an' a-playin',"" he
said. ""I 'members one of our little verses run somethin' lak dis:
Shoo, shoo, shoo gander
Th'ow yo' feathers 'way yander.
""Us had ol' corn hollers, too, but I fergits um now. I does remember
though you could hear dem niggers holler a whole mile.
""No'm, it warn't so bad wid us. De white folks was good to us niggers.
Us had 'nough to eat, lak greens, frum de big house. Us had our rations
weighted out; peck o' meal, three pounds of meat, half gallon of
'lasses, made at home in wodden mills; an' dat was for a week. An'
sometimes, on a Sunday us had a little sugar, coffee an' flour. No'm, us
didn't know what rice was.
""What I seed of slavery was a bad idea, I reckon, but ev'ybody thought
dey marster was de bes' in de lan'. Us didn't know no better. A man was
growed plum' green 'fo he knew de whole worl' didn't belong to his ol'
marster.
""Us didn't have no bought medicine in dem days; jes' whut us got outta
de woods lak slippery ellum fer fever an' poke salad root; dey he'p a
lot. An' May-apple root would he'p you same as castor oil.
""Didn't nobody he'p us learn nothin' much, but mos' of my chilluns went
to Booker T's school. Dey say he's a mighty smart man, an' my chilluns
thinks so, too. It's all right; I wish I could read an' write; den I'd
tell you things you'd lak to know.""
His face clouded for the briefest moment.
""I tell you de fust thing I 'members, an' I don't know whut started it.
One day my mammy done sumpin' an' ol' marster made her pull her dress
down 'roun' her waist an' made her lay down 'crost de door. Den he taken
a leather strop an' whooped her. I 'members dat I started cryin' an'
Mistus Beckie said, 'Go git dat boy a biskit.'
""I reckerlecks my mammy was a plow han' an' she'd go to work soon an'
put me under de shade of a big ol' post-oak tree. Dere I sat all day,
an' dat tree was my nurse. It still standin' dere yit, an' I won't let
nobody cut it down.
""Mammy say I never did learn to walk; jes' one day she sot me down under
de oak, an' fust thing she knowed she look up an' dere I was walkin'
down de middle of a cotton row.
""'Nother thing I 'members when I was a little boy; dat dey was 'vidin'
de corn atter de s'render. Dr. DeGraffenreid measured de corn out to all
of 'em whut was share han's. He'd take a bushel an' give 'em a bushel.
When he mos' through he'd throw a ear of corn to dis one, an' give
himse'f a ear; den he break a ear in two, an' he take part an' give dem
part. Dat was close measurin', I tell you.
""Us lived in de third house frum de big house in de quarter, an' when I
was a boy it was my job to set out shade trees. An' one day de Ku Klux
come ridin' by an' dey leader was Mister Steve Renfroe. (Alabama bandit
of Reconstruction days). He wore long hair an' he call my pappy out an'
ax him a heap of questions. While he sittin' dere his horse pull up nigh
'bout all de trees I done sot out.
""Atter talkin' to my pappy, he rode on 'cross Horn's bridge, 'bout two
miles souf of here, an' dere he met Ol' Man Enoch Sledge an' Frank
Sledge. Dey was darkies whut b'longed to Marsa Simmy Sledge's father,
Ol' Doctor Sledge. Slaves on dat plantation was 'lowed pretty good
privilege atter de s'rrender an' was workin' on halvens. Uncle Enoch an'
Frank was in town tradin' some, an' Mr. Renfroe didn't want 'em to have
anything. When dey lef' town, dey pass de Ku Kluxes raght on de slough
bridge. Mister Renfroe ax Enoch to give him a piece of string to fix his
saddle wid; den shot him. Frank run to de river, but de Ku Kluxes
cotched him an' shot him, too.
""De niggers went down to de river dat night an' got de bodies an' buried
'em in de ol' Travis graveyard. My mammy an' daddy is buried dere, too.
""Didn' nobody do nothin' 'bout Mister Renfroe 'till he went on an' got
to messin' wid Marsa Simmy Sledge's things; stole a pair of mules an' de
white folks rambled atter him 'till dey foun' him in Linden. Dey got so
hot atter him dat he went to his camp in de flat woods down on Bear
Creek. Dem was skeery times, 'case dat man never had no mercy for
nobody.
""Dey's a cave down by de burial grounds whut de slaves dug when dey run
away, an' Mister Renfroe stayed dere. It's on de river bank an' its dug
up. You digs an' starts low an' pushes de dirt out an' digs up an' makes
a big room up so de water won't git you. I knows whar dey's two of de
caves on de place; my cow fell in one yestidy.
""When Ol' Marster Amos Travis come out here from Californy, he taken a
lakin' to me an' wanted me to leave t'other side of de place an' move
down dis side of de big house to take keer of dis swamp an' look atter
de han's. But I wanted a big house wid four rooms an' two brick
chimneys, an' I had to talk five years to git it. I's got some
rosebushes now dat was at de big house raght atter de s'rrender, an'
dey's growin' in my yard now.
""Speakin' 'bout graveyard, I was passin' dere one night, ridin' on 'bout
midnight, an' sumpin' come draggin' a chain by me lak a dog. I got down
off'n my horse, but couldn't see nothin' wid no chain, so I got back on
de horse an' dere raght in front of me was a Jack-Me-Lantern wid de
brightes' light you ever seed. It was tryin' to lead me off, an' ev'y
time I'd git back in de road it would lead me off ag'in. You sho' will
git los' if you follow a Jack-Me-Lantern.
""One of dem led a man down to de creek by dem double bridges; said he
foun' he was travelin' in de wrong direction, gittin' frum home stidder
clo'ster, so he jes' sit down under a tree an' waited 'til daylight. I
ain't skeered of nothin' but dem Jack-Me-Lanterns, but dey stirs you up
in yo' min' till you can't tell whar you's at; an' dey's so bright dey
nigh 'bout puts yo' eyes out. Dey is plenty of 'em over by de graveyard
raght over yonder whar all my white folks is buried, an' mammy an'
pappy, too. Dey's all dere 'cept Marsa Jess Travis; he was de nex' whut
come in line for de place, an' he was de bes' frein' dis here nigger
ever had.
""Fac' was, dat's whut he call me; 't was 'nigger'. He an' Mistus Mag
lived raght dere in de big house; den dey move into town an' dat's whar
he died. Me an' Marsa Jess made a 'greement an' he said if he was de
longes' liver, he'd see me buried, an' if I be de longes' liver, I see
him buried. So dat day I went to his office in de co'thouse an' he say
he want to talk wid me. He say, 'You 'members us 'greement?' An' I say,
'Whut 'greement, Marsa Jess?' An' he say, 'Bout buryin'.' Den I say,
sho', 'I 'members dat.'
""Den he got up an' give me some papers 'bout some lan', an' I say, 'Whut
do all dis here mean, Marse Jess?' He say, 'nothin', nigger, 'cept I's
jes' goin' outta business.' Den I say, 'Goodbye, Marse Jess,' an' he
say, 'Goodbye, nigger,' an' I walked on 'crost de street. Den Mr.
Killian say, 'Oliver, whut's happened over at de co'thouse?' An I say,
'Ain't nothin' as I knows of.' Den he say, 'Yes, dey is; jes' look at de
peoples gwine in a hurry.' Den I turn 'roun' an' run back an' dere lay
Marse Jess. Mr. Smith was gettin' him up an' Marse Jess say to me,
'Well, nigger, I didn't do whut I tended to; I missed it.' An' I say,
'Boss, fer God's sake go to de hospital; I'll go wid you an' stay wid
you.' Mistus Mag, she ast me to beg him, but he shuck his head an' say
'If I had a-wanted to live I wouldn't of shot myself.' He res' a minit,
den say, 'Nigger, write Miss Calline an' tell her I says to always be
good to you as long as you lives.'
""Yassum, I was raght dere, done jes' whut I tol' him I'd do; kep' my
'greement an' followed him to de grave. Co'se dat last 'bout Marse Jess
ain't no slavery tale, but I thought you was atter hearin' all 'bout de
family whut owned dis ol' place; an' Marse Jess was de bes' white frein'
a nigger ever had; dis nigger, anyhow.""","Interview with Oliver Bell

Interview with Ank Bishop

Ruby Pickens Tartt, Livingston, Alabama
When ""Gabr'el take his silver trump,"" he is going to blow soft for the
saved and loud for the lost souls, according to Ank Bishop who was born
into slavery eighty-nine years ago, and lives in Livingston, Alabama.
The days before the war were as good as the present, Ank believes. He
tells of them in the following story of his life:
""My name is Ank Bishop, en I was born in 1849, August 16th, at Ward,
Alabama. My mother's name was Amy Larken, an' my father was Tom Bishop.
I had three brothers, Alf, Volen an' Jim, an' two sisters, Cely an'
Matildy. Us belonged to Lady Liza Larkin at Ward, right nigh Coke's
Chapel.
""My mother was brought out from South Car'lina in a speculator drove,
an' Lady Liza bought her at de auction at Coke's Chapel. She lef' her
mammy an' daddy back dere in South Car'lina an' never did see 'em no
more in dis life. She was bidded off an' Lady Liza got her, jes' her one
from all her family. She was got fer Lady Liza's house gal. But
sometimes she cooked or was de washer, den ag'in de milker. 'Twas my job
for to min' de ca'ves. Sometimes I went to Mr. Ed Western's sto' at
Gaston, three miles from us house, to see iffen was any mail for Lady
Liza, but 'twa'n't none.
""Dey was good to us 'caze Lady Liza's son, Mr. Willie Larkin, was de
overseer for his ma, but co'se sometime dey git among 'em an' thrashed
'em out. One time one de niggers runned away, old Caesar Townsy, an' dey
sarnt for Dick Peters to come an' bring his ""nigger dogs."" Dem dogs was
trained to ketch a nigger same as rabbit dogs is trained to ketch a
rabbit. So Mr. Willie Larkin told Stuart for to say to old man Dick
Peters when he come, 'I'm gone,' but for him to come on. 'I'm gwineter
keep de road,' he say, 'an' cross 'Bigbee at Moscow landin'.' So ol'
Dick Peters, he kept de road lack he tole him to, an' he cross 'Bigbee
at Moscow landin' over in de cane-brake. But dem nigger dogs didn't
never ketch ol' man Caesar. He stayed right wharever he was at 'twell
after S'render, an' de War done ceased. Den he come out, but iffen he
had a been caught, dey'd a used him up pretty rough, but he stayed hid
twell de time done passed.
""All de women on Lady Liza's place had to go to de fiel' ev'y day an'
dem what had suckerlin' babies would come in 'bout nine o'clock in de
mawnin' an' when de bell ring at twelve an' suckerlin' 'em. One woman
tended to all of 'em in one house. Her name was Ellie Larkin, an' dey
call her 'Mammy Larkin.' She all time sarnt me down in de fiel' for to
git 'em come suckle de chillen, 'caze dat made hit hard on her when dey
gets hongry an' cry.
""Us didn't get to go to church none, an' us wa'n't larnt nothin'. I'm
nigh 'bout ninety an' I can't read a line. I got some chillun kin read;
one can't whut is sixty-five, but Henry he fifteen an' he kin. De ma,
she go by de name of Pearlie Beasley, she can't read neither, but she's
a good fiel' han' an' she patched dese breeches I'm wearin' an' dis ole
shirt. Miss, I ain't got a coat to my name. Can't go to church, so I
doan' know dat dis any better'n slav'y time. Hit's hard, anyway you got
to travel, got yo' nose on de groun' rock all de time. When pay day
come, ain't nothin' pay wid. Come git de rent, den you out do's ag'in.
Bred an' bawn in Sumter County, wore out in Sumter County, 'specks to
die in Sumter County, an' whut is I got? Ain't got nothin', ain't got
nothin', ain't got nothin'.
Ank Bishop, Livingston, Alabama
""But I'm a believer, an' dis here voodoo an' hoodoo an' sper'ts ain't
nothin' but a lot of folk's outten Christ. Ha'nts ain't nothin' but
somebody died outten Christ an' his sper't ain't at res', jes' in a
wand'rin' condition in de world.
""Dis is de evil sper't what de Bible tells about when hit say a person
has got two sper'ts, a good one an' a evil one. De good sper't goes to a
place of happiness an' rest, an' you doan' see hit no mo', but de evil
sper't ain't got no place to go. Hit's dwellin' place done tore down
when de body died, an' hit's jes' a wand'rin' an a waitin' for Gabr'el
to blow his trump, den de worl' gwineter come to an en'. But when God
say, 'Take down de silver mouf trump an' blow, Gabr'el,' an' Gabr'el
say, 'Lord, how loud shell I blow?' Den de Lord say, 'Blow easy,
Gabr'el, en ca'm, not to 'larm my lilies.' De secon' time Gabr'el say,
'How loud mus' I blow, Lord?' Den de Lord say, 'Blow hit as loud as
seben claps of thunder all added into one echo, so as to wake up dem
damnable sper'ts sleepin' in de grave-ya'ds what ain't never made no
peace wid dey God, jes' alayin' dere in dey sins.'
""But de Christ'en Army, hit gits up wid de fus' trump, an' dem
what is deef is de evil ones what anybody kin see anytime. I ain't
skeered of 'em, though. I passes 'em an' goes right on plowin',
but iffen you wants 'em to git outten your way, all you gotter do
is jes' turn your head least bit an' look back. Dey gone jes' lack
dat! When my fus' wife died 'bout thirty years ago, I was goin' up
to Gaston to see Sara Drayden, ole Scot Drayden's wife, an' I tuck
out through Kennedy bottom 'bout sundown right after a rain. I
seed sompin acomin' down de road 'bout dat high, 'bout size a little
black shaggy dog, an' I says, 'What's dat I sees commin' down de
road? Ain't nobody 'roun' here got no black shaggy dog? Hit kep'
a-comin' an' kep' a-gittin' bigger an' bigger an' closer an' closer,
an' time hit got right to me 'twas as big as a ha'f growed yearlin',
black as a crow. It had four feet an' drop years, jes' lack a dog,
but 'twa'n't no dog, I knows dat. Den he shy out in de bushes, an'
he come right back in de road, an' hit went on de way I was comin'
from, so I went on de way hit was comin' from. I ain't never seed
dat thing no mo'. But I'ze gotter pretty good notion 'bout who
hit 'twas.""","Interview with Ank Bishop

Interview with Amy Chapman
-
Ruby F. Tartt, Livingston, Alabama
Aunt Amy paused as she worked among the small plants in her garden,
removing a weed here and there. She pushed back the sunbonnet that
shaded her eyes and began:
""I was bawn on Governor Reuben Chapman's place five miles north of
Livingston on May 14, 1843. My name is Amy Chapman. My mother was Clary
Chapman an' my pappy was Bob Chapman. Dey both come from Virginny; my
mammy from Petersburg an' my pappy f'um Richmond. Dey was driv' down to
Alabamy lak cattle an' Marse Reuben bought 'em. He had a lot of slaves
caze he had a heap of plantations, but him an' his wife stay most of de
time in Huntsville an' dey had a heap of white oberseers. I had a plenty
of chilluns but not as many as my mammy.
""Who was my husban'? Law chile, I ain't never had no special husban'. I
even forgits who was de pappy of some of dese chilluns of mine.
""Us had a mean oberseer, an' since Marse Reuben warn't never at home,
dem oberseers useter treat us somp'n awful. One day Marse Reuben come
home an' when he foun' out dat de oberseer was mean to de slaves he
commence to give him a lecture, but when Miss Ferlicia tuk a han' in de
business, she didn't stop at no lecture, she tol' dat oberseer dis: 'I
hear you take my women an' turn dere clothes ober dere haids an' whup
'em. Any man dat's got a family an' would do sich a thing oughter be
sham' of hisself, an' iffen Gov. Chapman can't make you leave, I kin, so
you see dat road dere? Well, make tracks den.' An' Mistis, he lef'
raght den. He didn't wait for no coaxin'. He was de meanes' oberseer us
ever had. He tuk my ol'est brother an' had him stretched out jus' lak
you see Christ on de cross; had him chained, an' I sot down on de groun'
by him an' cried all night lack Mary an' dem done. Dat oberseer was de
fus' one dat ever putt me in de fiel', an' he whupped me wid de cat er
nine tails when I was stark naked.
""Den dere was anudder mean man named [...] who was always a-beatin'
nigger women caze dey wouldn't mind him.
""Us warn't learned to read an' write, but Mr. Jerry Brown's slaves were.
He owned a big plantation. Us didn't go to no nigger church, caze dere
warn't none. I was babtized in Jones Creek, an' Dr. Edmon's a white
preacher, j'ined me to de Jones Creek Babtist Church long fo' de war,
an' de song I lacked bes' was a white folks song. Twarn't no nigger
song. It was lack dey sing it now, 'cep' mo' lovely, Miss, mo' lovely.
Dark was de night
Col' was de groun'
On which my Savior lay
Blood in draps of sweat run down
In agony he pray.
Lawd, move did bitter cup
If sich dy sacred will
If not content I'll drink it up
Whose pleasure I'll fullfil.
""An' anudder one us niggers useter sing was might pretty:
In evil long I tuk de light
An' led by shame an' fear
When a new object stopped my flight
An' stopped my wild career.
I saw him hangin' on a tree
In agony an' blood
He fixed his languid eyes on me
As near his cross I stood.
Sho' never till my latter breath
Kin I forgit dat look
He seemed to change me wid his death
Yit not a word he spoke.
My conscience felt an' owned de quilt
An' plunged me in despair
I saw my sins his blood had spilt
An' helped to nail him dere.
""Yassum, I kin tell you things about slavery times dat would make yo'
blood bile, but dey's too turrible. I jus' tries to forgit.
Amy Chapman, Livingston, Alabama
""I could tell you 'bout bein' run myself wid dem nigger dogs, but I
ain't gwineter do it. I will tell you dough 'bout a mean man who whupped
a cullid woman near 'bout to death. She got so mad at him dat she tuk
his baby chile what was playin' roun' de yard and grab him up an'
th'owed it in a pot of lye dat she was usin' to wash wid. His wife come
a-hollin' an' run her arms down in de boilin' lye to git de chile out,
an' she near 'bout burnt her arms off, but it didn't do no good 'caze
when she jerked de chile out he was daid.
""One day I seed ole Unker Tip Toe all bent over a-comin' down de road
an' I ax him whut ail him an' he say: 'I's been in de stocks an' been
beat till de blood come. Den ole Massa 'ninted my flesh wid red papper
an' turpentine an' I's been most dead but I is somewhat better now.'
Unker Tiptoe belonged to de meanes' ol' marster around here.
""But, honey, I ain't never tol' nobody all dis an' ain't gwine tell you
no mo'. Ride me home now, caze I's cripple; a cow was de cause of it.
She drug me roun' dat new orchard whut I planted las' fall. She done run
away wid me. Mistis I wished you would do me a favor an' write my son in
Texas an' tell him dat I say, iffen he 'specks me to make him anymo' of
dem star quilts, he better come on here an' kiver my house. De roof sho'
does leak bad.""","Interview with Amy Chapman

Interview with Laura Clark
-
Ruby Pickens Tartt, Livingston, Alabama
Laura Clark, black and wrinkled with her eighty-six years, moved
limpingly about the tiny porch of her cabin on the outskirts of
Livingston. Battered cans and rickety boxes were filled with a profusion
of flowers of the common variety. Laura offered me a split-bottomed
chair and lowered herself slowly into a rocker that creaked even under
her frail body. ""Po'ly, Miss, po'ly,"" she responded to my query about
her health. ""Tain't lack de old days. I's crippled and mos' blin' now
atter all de years what I got.
""I was born on Mr. Pleasant Powell's place in North Ca'lina, and when I
was 'bout six or seven years ole I reckon hit 'twas, Mr. Garret from
right up yonder in de bend, 'bout eight miles from Livingston gwine
no'th on de Livingston and Epes road, bought ten of us chillun in North
Ca'lina and sont two white men, and one was Mr. Skinner, to fotch us
back in waggins. En he fotch ole Julie Powell and Henry to look atter
us. Wa'n't none of dem ten chillun no kin to me, and he never bought my
mammy, so I had to leave her behine.
""I recollect Mammy said to old Julie, 'Take keer my baby chile (dat was
me) an iffen I never sees her no mo' raise her for God.' Den she fell
off de waggin where us was all settin' and roll over on de groun' jes'
acryin'. But us was eatin' candy what dey done give us for to keep us
quiet, and I didn't have sense 'nuff for to know what ailed Mammy, but I
knows now and I never seed her no mo' in dis life. When I heered from
her atter S'render she done dead and buried. Her name was Rachel Powell.
My pappy's name I don't know ca'se he done been sole to somewhars else
when I was too little to recollect. But my mammy was de mother of
twenty-two chillun and she had twins in her lap when us driv' off. My
gran'mammy said when I lef', 'Pray, Laura, and be er good gal, and min'
bofe white and black. Ev'body will lack you and iffen you never see me
no mo' pray to meet me in heaven.' Den she cried. Her name was Rose
Powell.
""Us all started den for Mr. Garrett's plantation down yonder in de bend,
ten chillun and two ole uns, and two white men, and us was travellin'
solid a month. Fuss thing Ole Marsa say was 'Now be good ter dese
motherless chillun.' Den he went to war, and de overseers forgot all
'bout dey promise. When Ole Marsa come back he done got his arm shot
off, but he let bofe dem overseers go, ca'se dey done whupped dat ole
'oman what come wid us to deaf. She brought her two little boys, Colvin
and 'Lias, but Joe, dey pappy, didn't come-he was sole 'fo 'Lias was
bawn. Joe never seed 'Lias.
Laura Clark, Livingston, Alabama
""I sets cross de road here from dat church over yonder and can't go
'ca'se I'm cripple' and blin', but I heers um singin':
A motherless chile sees a hard time
Oh, Lord, he'p her on de road.
'Er sister will do de bes' she kin
Dis is a hard world, Lord, fer a motherless chile.
""And I jes' busts out cryin'. Dat was de song I had in view to sing for
you, hit's so mournful. I knowed 'twa'n't no reel, 'twa'n't nothin' lack
no reel, 'ca'se I been b'longin' to de church for fifty-five years, and
I don't fancy no reel. I'm glad I got hit to my min' 'fo' you lef'. But
my recollection is shaller. I ain't never read no verse in no Bible in
my life, ca'se I can't read. Some my chillun kin, though. My husban'
died and lef' me wid nine chillun, none of um couldn't pull de others
outer de fire iffen dey fell in. I had mo'n dat, but some come here dead
and some didn't. I got chillun dead in Birmingham and Bessemer. Dey
ain't a graveyard in dis here settlement 'roun' Prospect where I ain't
got chillun buried. Hettie Ann, right up dere ter Mr. Hawkins'
graveyard, and my boy whut got killed settin' on de side de road eatin'
his dinner, he' buried in Captain Jones' place in de bend yonder.
""Yassum, I been drug about and put through de shackles so bad I done
forgot some of dey names, and I mos' blin' now and can't hear good
neither. But my eyes is good nuff for to see ghosts, but I don't b'lieve
in 'em, 'ca'se I'd see dem chillun sometime effen dey was ghosties. I
know I'd see my boy, ca'se dey showed me his head whar dat Miller boy
hit him in de head wid a spade and split his head wide open, slip up
behin' him and all he said was 'Squeek,' jes' lack a hog, and he was
dead. And de murderer live right here but dey move and now I'm here.
When hit rain us jes' gets under de bed 'ca'se de house ain't got no top
on hit.
Laura Clark's House, Livingston, Alabama
""I can't say Marse Garrett wa'n't good to us motherless chillun but de
overseer, Mr. Woodson Tucker, was mean as anybody. He'd whup you nigh
'bout to deaf, and had a whuppin' log what he strip 'em buck naked and
lay 'em on de log. He whup 'em wid a wide strop, wider'n my han', den he
pop de blisters what he raise and 'nint 'em wid red pepper, salt, and
vinegar. Den he put 'em in de house dey call de pest house and have a
'oman stay dere to keep de flys offen 'em 'twell dey get able to move.
Den dey had reg'lar men in de fields wid spades, and iffen you didn't do
what you git tole, de overseer would wrop dat strap 'roun' his han' and
hit you in de haid wid de wooden handle 'til he kilt you. Den de mens
would dig a hole wid de spades and throw 'em in hit right dere in de
fiel' jes' lack dey was cows-didn't have no funeral nor nothin'.
""Us had a heap of houses in de quarters right on bofe sides de Big
House. Us could step outer one house to 'tother. But, Miss, I didn't
work so hard or have no trouble either. I was in de house atter Marsa
come home and foun' me splittin' rails and plowin'. He 'lowed dey done
put me in too hard a ship, and I was too little, so he tuck me to de
house to draw water and wash dishes, 'ca'se I was a little motherless
gal. Ole Marsa done a good part by me, and I was married to my fuss
husban', Cary Crockett, right dere in de parlor. He tole de overseer dat
us was human and had feelin's same as him, so he rejected de
paterrollers and made 'em git off de place. I was treated good, 'ca'se I
'membered what my gran'ma say, and whatever dey tole me to put my han'
to, I did, and I was obedient and wasn't hardheaded lack some de res.' I
had no trouble, and wasn't 'buked none. But I's had mo' trouble las' ten
years wid my own chillun den I ever did in slav'y time. Dey gives me
sich bitter words till I can't swaller 'em and I jes' sets and cries. I
can't read no songs to comfort me, jes' ketch 'em from de preacher on de
stan' and hole 'em, dat's de way I ketch my larnin'.
""Las' sermon I hyard, he tuck his tex' en said, 'Don't nobody
rob God.' Den he say, 'Effen you is goin' to 'tend to serve God, serve
Him in de full, 'ca'se God don't never bat a eye, nor turn His haid
and he kin see you. He frowns at ev'y sin, but He's a sinforgivin'
man.' I use to know a heap 'bout de Lord, but I'm so cripple' an
blin' since de ca'f jumped on my foot I can't go to church no mo', so
I done forgot.
""You ax 'bout dem flowers on de po'ch-I sho' wish dey was mine, you
could have 'em 'ca'se dey ain't room nuff wid dem for me ter sit whar I
desire. Us ain't got no meal and here 'tis jes' Tuesday-no mo' till
Saddy. Sho' is bad; us jes' 'pends on de neighbors and borrys.""","Interview with Laura Clark

Interview with Jake Green

Ruby Pickens Tartt, Livingston, Alabama
""Yessum, dem niggers sho' was scared when ole Buck showed up in de
fiel',"" Jake Green, former slave, laughed with a vigor that denied his
eighty-five years as he described ""a conju' what didn' wuk."" Jake has a
vivid memory of those days before the Civil War, though he was only a
small boy when it started.
""Me an' my mother an' father b'longed to old man Lam Whitehead jes' a
few miles from Coatopa, 'bout ten miles east of Livingston, Alabama,"" he
began. ""My mother was Molly Whitehead, my father was Dan Whitehead. I
don't know nothin' 'bout my gran'mammy an' gran'pappy, but I had a heap
of unkies.
""Mr. Whitehead owned Dirtin Ferry down to Belmont, an' dey had a darkey
dere named Dick what claim sick all de time. So de Massa man said,
'Dick, dam it, go to de house. I can't get no work outten you.' So Dick
went on. He was a fiddler so dey jes' tuck his vittuls to him for seven
years. Den one day, Old Massa say to de overseer man, 'Let's slip up
dere an' see what Dick doin'. So dey did, an' dere sot Dick, fat as he
could be a-playin' de fiddle an' a-singin',
'Fool my Massa seben years.
Gwiner fool him seben mo'.
Hey diddle, de diddle, de diddle, de do'.'
""'Bout dat time Ole Massa poked his head in de do' said 'Dam iffen you
will. Come outten dere, you black rascal, an' go to work, 'An' I ain't
never hyard of Dick complainin' no mo'.
""But dey wan't so mean. Sometimes us got whupped but Massa had fo' men
he didn't 'low nobody to hit, white er black. Dey was Unker Arch, he was
de main carriage driver; my father, he was de house servant; Unker
Julius, de fo'man of de plow han's an' Unker Ed'erds, de fo'man of de
hoe han's. Whenever anybody wanted to hire anybody to work for 'em, de
Massa send dem fo' out an' hire 'em by de day to chop cotton or pick.
An' dem fo' niggers could chop much cotton in a day as de mule could
plow. Whenever dey'd stop de plow at twelve o'clock, dem niggers was
right dere to lay de hoe handles on de plow, an' dat's choppin'. All
four could pick a bale of cotton a day. Whenever anybody say, 'Mr.
Whitehead, I want a bale of cotton picked today,' he'd send dem fo' men
an' dey could pick five hundred pounds apiece an' leave de sun still
runnin'. Dey was pickers in dem days!
""Cose dey had to begin, an' all us got up 'fo' day. Twan't nothin'
strange to be standin' in de fiel' by your plow waitin' for de sun to
come up. Ev'body was early risers in dem days. Dey was pretty good to
us, but ole Mr. Buck Brasefiel', what had a plantation 'jinin' us'n, was
so mean to his'n dat twan't nothin' for 'em to run away. One nigger,
Rich Parker, runned off one time an' whilst he gone he seed a hoodoo
man, so when he got back Mr. Brasefiel' tuck sick an' stayed sick two or
three weeks. Some of de darkies tole him, 'Rich been to de hoodoo
doctor.' So Mr. Brasefiel' got up outten dat bed an' come a-yellin' in
de fiel', 'You thought you had ole Buck, but by God he rose agin'. Dem
niggers was so skeered, dey squatted in de fiel' jes' lack partridges,
an' some of 'em whispered, 'I wish to God he had a-died.'
Jake Green, Livingston, Alabama
""'Twan't long atter dat come S'render, but dat nigger done lef' dere,
an' didn't nobody know whar Parker was at. Some of de niggers done
bought an' paid for dey mule an' me an' Pappy was rentin' an' wukkin' on
sneers, when here come Parker, jes' hyared 'bout S'render. He say 'Why
didn't somebody come tell me 'twas S'render?' Den he start a-singin'
Slav'y chain, slav'y chain,
Thank God a'mighty I'm free at las',
Free at las', free at las',
Thank God a'mighty I'm free at las'.
""But dat wan't none of Old Massa's niggers. He had one, do' call him
John, an' hit come a traveler an' stayed all night. Ole Massa p'inted
out John, an' said, 'He ain't never tole me a lie in his life.' De
traveler bet Massa a hund'ed dollars 'ginst fo' bits he'd ketch John in
a lie 'fo' he lef'. Next mawnin' at de table de mice was pretty bad, so
de traveler caught one by de tail an' put him inside a kiver-lid dish
what was settin' dere on de table, an' he tole Ole Massa tell John he
could eat sumpin' out of ev'y dish atter dey got th'oo but dat kiver-lid
one, an' not to take kiver offen hit. An' John said, 'Nossuh, I won't.'
But John jes' nachully had to see what was in dat dish, so he raise de
lid, an' out hopped de mouse. Den hyar come Old Massa an' axed John
iffen he done what he tole him not to do, an' John 'nied hit. Den de
traveler look in de dish an' de mouse wan't dere, an' he said, 'See
dere, John been lyin' to you all de time, you jes' ain't knowed hit,'
an' I reckon he right 'caze us had to lie.""","Interview with Jake Green

Interview with Charity Grigsby

R.P. Tartt, [HW: Livingston?]
Charity Grigsby lives in a tumbledown shanty about nine miles from
Livingston on the old Epes road. She was sewing on a quilt when I
arrived; humming an old plantation song that ran:
Angels in de water, walkin' by de light;
Po' sinners stand in darkness an' cannot see de light!
A broad smile flowed across her black face as I entered the cabin. She
placed her needle aside, exclaimed: ""Law me, honey, I's always proud
when de white folks drap aroun'; an' dat's directly so.""
""Charity,"" I said, ""I want you to tell me about slavery times.""
She lowered her head in thought a moment, said:
""Honey, what would I tell?""
""Just all you remember, Charity.""
And this is what she told:
""Honey, I was borned Charity Grigsby, but I married Nelson Grigory;
ain't much 'stinguish in de names; but 'twas a little. My pappy was
Dan'l Grigsby an' my mammy was Mary Moore. See, us belonged to Ol'
Mister Jim Moore right up yonder 'bove Sumterville near Ramsey Station.
Charity Grigsby, Livingston, Alabama
""You goes up de Gainesville an' Livingston Road an' turns off at de
cross road 'bout nine miles from Livingston. Den you goes due west. It
ain't far from dere; bout six miles, I reckons. 'Twan't no big
plantation; 'bout a dozen of us dere; an' Marse Jim didn't have no
overseer lak de rest. He had dem boys of his'n what seed to us. Dey was
John an' William an' Jim. Dey was all tol'able good to us; but dey would
whoop us if we wasn't 'bedient; jes' like a mother raisin' a chile.
""I can't say how old I is; it's done got away from me; but I was a
stroppin' gal durin' de war. I knows I's eighty-five an' I 'spects I's
more dan dat. I's de mammy of 'leven chilluns; I knows dat; but ain't
but five of dem a-livin'. As you knows, I lives wid two of dem; Mattie
an' Evie. Dey treats me good. Hattie an' Ellen an' my boy lives in
Bessemer. Dat is all my individual chilluns, but I's got a few others. I
can't recollect much to tell; been a good while since de war; but when
you calls it to my 'memberance I can think it up.
""Honey, dem nigger dogs; dey sho' did run. Sometimes dey kotched a
nigger, but dey didn't never run me. I was in de house weavin' an'
spinnin' lak mistus showed me; an' I didn't never get in no trouble wid
nobody.
""An' den again, Marse Jim was purty tol'able good to us, but Mr. Ervin
Lavendar was sho' mean to his niggers, an' his plantation warn't far
from our'n. He had a pack of dogs what run de niggers; an' dem was
skeery times, I tell you. Us didn't l'arn no schoolin' nor go nowhere
nor have no corn shuckin' nor nothin'; jes' 'quired to stay in de
cabins. I hyared 'bout Bre'r Rabbit an' hoodoo; but I never takes up no
time wid dat foolishness; never seed no sense in it. Us got on all right
'thout dat.
""Some of de other niggers 'sides me was all de time in trouble, dough.
Mr. Fulton, who lived clost to Mr. Lavendar, had a nigger-driver an'
overseer name Sanders, an' I bet he was de meanest one of dem all. You
know, honey, dey planted wheat fields in de fall in dem days an' cut it
in de spring. It would come off in time 'nuff to make corn.
""Dere was a flock of birds lak blackbirds; only dey was wheat birds;
an' dey went in droves an' fly way up yonder. Us had planks to slap
together to keep de birds out er de wheat, because dey et it up.
""Well'm, one day Mr. Sanders tol' one of de women what was one of de
sucklers on de place, dat if she wouldn't do what he axed her to dey was
a black coffin over her haid. She 'fused him; so when he was loadin' his
gun dere in de wheat fiel', he was holdin' de gun barrel propped under
his chin, jes' so, an de other end settin' on de ground. Well sir, it
went off an' he killed hisse'f stid of dat sucklin' woman; an' dat was a
awful time, 'ca'se de niggers got skeered an' run, an' dey sot Mr.
Lavendar's pack of nigger dogs on 'em. De dogs kotched some an' chewed
'em nigh 'bout to death. It warn' none of us, but it were close.
""Us laid low, didn't go out nowhere. Us wasn't 'lowed to; couldn't go to
prayer meetin' or nothin'.
Charity Grigsby's House, Livingston, Alabama
""You ax what dat song I singin' when you come? Dat was all of it, an'
dat's 'nuff fer me, 'ca'se it's true. What dey gwine to be no mo' fer?
Jes':
Angels in de water, walkin' by de light;
Po' sinners stan' in darkness an' cannot se de light.
""I don' want no mo' myse'f; jes' dat; dat's all. How come you wants some
mo'? Don't dat much satisfy you? But honey, de sun gettin' low an' my
chilluns will soon be comin' from de swamps. Ain't no bread cooked fer
'em. I'll tell you some mo' when I gets my mind on it, 'ca'se it's been
a good while since de war.
""Yas'm, us has 'nuff to eat; but if us could get anymore, us would lak
it. You know how 'tis; can make out wid mighty little. Us eats greens;
lookin' forward to roas' in years comin' in.""","Interview with Charity Grigsby

Interview with Hilliard Johnson
-
Ruby Pickens Tartt, Livingston, Alabama
Uncle Hilliard Johnson and his wife Callie live on the Johnson place
about three and a half miles from Livingston, Ala., the same place
Hilliard was brought as an infant of two in slavery days. He and Callie
tend their own little patch of ground and they own a mule. White friends
patch up the gaps in their financial structure and everybody knows them.
Uncle Hilliard pulled up his mule in front of my house and climbed down
from the high seat, leaving Callie sitting placidly in the sun.
He came around to the kitchen door and announced that he was here,
""'ca'se he got de word I wanted to ax him somepin.""
""Uncle Hilliard,"" I said, ""I want to hear all about you and your family
and whom you belonged to in slavery time.""
""Well, Miss Ruby, iffen you is knowed me all dese years and still don'
know who I'm is, and my family is, and who us belonged to, dey ain't no
use of me stoppin' now to tell you. 'Sides, I's sick, I's been to de
horspital in York, Dr. Hills', and he wants to operate. I's skeered of
de knife and ain't got no money neither.
""I can't eat nothin' but tomato soup. Dem sho' is nice ones
you got dere on de she'f, and oyster soup and rice soup and all lac
dat. Can't eat no rough vittles lac collards. I ain't gittin' on
well atall, but I'll 'blige you a while. I was thinkin' other day
'bout you and dem ole sperichel hymns I leads out to Mount Pilgrim.
You's got 'Oh Lord, I'm a Waitin' on You', ain't you? I knowed you
had dat 'bout 'And I Can't Do Nothin' Until You Comes. Sho Can't.'
Well, here's one you ain't got, 'ca'se hit's a really old sperichel
my gran'maw use to sing. I's sorter hoarse today, but hit go:
Jes' carry me and bury me
I'll rise at de comin' day.
Jes' carry me and bury me,
I'll rise at de comin' day.
""Now dat's jes' de chorus and de verse say:
When I was in my worldly ways
Nobody had nothin' to say.
Now I'm ridin' de pale white hoss
Ev'ybody got something to say.""
""Den de chorus ag'in, and hit's a pretty one sho's you bawn.""
I mentioned the figure of speech ""pale white hoss"", but he ""didn't know
nothin' 'bout no figures!""
""And another one, dey is so many, let me see. Here one but I jes' can't
call to mine a heap of verses:
Trouble here and dey's trouble dere,
I really do believe dere's trouble ev'ywhere.
Swing low, chariot, I'm gwine home.
Swing low, chariot, I'm gwine home.""
""Den hit goes on and tell 'bout de moaner, says:
Oh, dey's a moaner here, dey's a moaner dere,
I really do b'lieve dey's a moaner ev'ywhere.
Swing low, chariot, I'm gwine home.
Swing low, chariot, I'm gwine home.
Oh dey's a sinner here, dey's a sinner dere,
I really do b'lieve dey's a sinner ev'ywhere.
Swing low, chariot, I'm gwine home.
Swing low, chariot, I'm gwine home.
Oh, dey's a Christun here, dey's a Christun dere
I really do b'lieve dey's a Christun ev'ywhere
Swing low, chariot, I'm gwine home.
Swing low, chariot, I'm gwine home.
""Den dey's a heap of 'em to dat song lac a ""deacon"" and a ""member"" and a
""prayer"" and a ""singer"", jes' a whole passel dem verses, but I reckon
dem will do today.
""Now what else you want, 'ca'se dem mules is tired and I is too. 'Sides
I got to see a man and Callie in de waggin and she's hot too. You knows
Callie, she my wife, my second wife, and us got twelve chillun in all,
growed and married. Us still live on de Johnson place three and a half
miles from Livingston right han' side de ole Boyd road west from town.
Us belonged to Miss Ella Johnson, she was us young Mistis, and Mr. Nep
Johnson, dat's de onliest ones I ever knowed. My mammy, Frances
Johnson, and my pappy, Alf Johnson, come from down 'bout Cubie Station.
Young Mist'iss bought 'em I reckon and my gran'maw, Rachel Johnson. Fus'
thing I knowed, us was livin' on Johnson place. Dey was good to us,
'bout seventy-five of us all together, I reckon. All I 'members, dey
looped de bridle rein over my feet an' let de mule drag me all over de
orchard. It hurt my head. And dey beat some of 'em up scan'lous, but dey
was pretty good to me, I reckon. See, I wa'n't so ole, jes' a young boy
in slavery time, but I recall young Massa told Tom, a young nigger dere,
one time not to go to de frolic.
""'Clean up dem dishes and go ter bed,' he say. And Tom said 'Yassuh' but
Marse Nep watch Tom th'oo de do' and atter while Tom slip out and away
he went, wid young Massa right 'hin' him. He got dere and foun' Tom
cuttin' groun' shuffle big as anybody. Young Massa called him, 'Tom,' he
say, 'Tom, didn't I tell you you couldn't come to dis frolic?' 'Yassuh,'
says Tom, 'You sho' did, and I jes' come to tell 'em I couldn't come!'
""Young Massa didn't hurt Tom none, but I is seed 'em strip 'em plum
nekked and nigh 'bout kill 'em. I did see 'em kill old Collin, but dey
done dat wid a shot gun jes' 'ca'se dey couldn't control him. Did they
have nigger dogs, you say? Yassum, dey sho' did, but I'm tellin' you de
troof now some of de black folks knowed how to git away from dem nigger
dogs jes' lac dey wa'n't dere. Mr. Joe Patton, you know Mr. Joe Patton
don' you? Young Mr. Joe, I'm talkin' 'bout what's over here in town and
use to be de sher'ff. Well, in his day, he done seed a nigger hoodoo dem
dogs 'ca'se dey had nigger dogs after S'render too. I kin tell you what
I seed, but what dey done now, I doan' know, I couldn't tell you dat.
But hit was a fair day, fair as 'tis now, and dey sot de dogs on dat
nigger and 'fo' yer knowed hit dat nigger done lef' dere and had dem
dogs treein' a nekked tree. 'Twa'n't nobody dere. Dey calls hit
hoodooin' de dogs. And I'se seen hit more times than one. Time I tell
you 'bout, Mr. Patton was ag'in. 'Twas a feller right here in town. I
forgits his name but he was a tall nigger, married Dennis Coleman's
daughter. You 'members Dennis Coleman, had dat gal call Hettie? Well, he
married Hettie, and he whooped her up mightily. She 'ported on him to de
sheriff, and he went to git him. I can't think what dat nigger go by
now, but anyhow Mr. Patton couldn't ketch him and he sot de dogs on him
and dey couldn't ketch him. Dey knowed whichaway he went, down 'bout
Bear Creek on Miss Mamie Smith's place in de flatwoods. 'Twa'n't no
trouble to ketch nobody down dere, but dem dogs couldn't do hit, and
fus' thing you know he run back to Hattie's.
""Now jes' give me a few tomatoes, Miss Ruby, and I mus' cut dis short.
Dey's a cloud comin' up over yonder by Peter's washpot and dat's when us
gits a rain. I got a fur piece to go for a old man. Yassum, I'se nigh
'bout seventy-nine years old and porely.""","Interview with Hilliard Johnson

Interview with Martha Bradley

Mabel Farrior, Montgomery, Alabama
Aunt Martha-as she is known to all her ""white folks""-claims to be 100
years old. She was a slave to Dr. Lucas of Mt. Meigs neighborhood long
before the War between the States. Dr. Lucas is one of the well known
Lucas family, with whom General LaFayette spent some time while touring
the United States in 1824.
""Our Marster wuz sho good to all his 'niggers',"" she said. ""Us allus had
plenty to eat and plenty to wear, but de days now is hard, if white
folks gin you a nickel or dime to git you sumpin' t' eat you has to
write everything down in a book before you can git it. I allus worked in
the field, had to carry big logs, had strops on my arms and them logs
was put in de strop and hauled to a pile where they all was. One morning
hit was rainin' ad I didn' wanna go to the field, but de oversee' he
come and got me and started whooping me. I jumped on him and bit and
kicked him 'til he lemme go. I didn't know no better then. I didn't know
he was de one to do dat.
""But Marster Lucas gin us big times on Christmas and July. Us 'ud have
big dinners and all the lemonade us could drink. The dinner'd be spread
out on de ground an' all the niggers would stand roun' and eat all dey
wanted. What was lef' us'd take it to our cabins. Nancy Lucas was de
cook fer eber' body. Well, she'd sho cook good cake and had plenty of
'em but she wouldn't lak to cut dem cakes often. She keep 'em in a safe.
One day I go to dat safe and I seed some and I wanted it so bad till I
jes' had to have some. Nancy say to me, 'Martha, did you cut dat cake?'
I say, 'No sir! dat knife just flew 'roun by itself and cut dat cake.'
""One day I was workin' in de field and de overseer he come 'roun and say
sumpin' to me he had no bizness say. I took my hoe and knocked him plum
down. I knowed I'se done sumpin' bad so I run to de bushes. Marster
Lucas come and got me and started whoopin' me. I say to Marster Lucas
whut dat overseer sez to me and Marster Lucas didn' hit me no more.
Marse Lucas was allus good to us and he wouldn' let nobody run over his
niggers.
""There was plenty white folks dat was sho bad to de niggers, and
specially dem overseers. A nigger whut lived on the plantation jinin'
ours shot and killed an overseer; den he run 'way. He come to de river
and seed a white man on udder side and say, 'Come and git me.' Well,
when dey got him dey found out whut he'd done, and was gwine to burn him
'live. Jedge Clements, the man dat keep law and order, say he wouldn't
burn a dog 'live, so he lef'. But dey sho burn dat nigger 'live for I
seed him atter he was burned up.
Martha Bradley, Montgomery, Alabama
""Us'd go to meetin' to de Antioch Church some Sundays. Us'd go to de
house and git a pass. When us'd pass by the patterole, us jes' hold up
our pass and den us'd go on. Dar was a 'vidin' 'twixt de niggers and de
white folks. De white preacher'd preach; den de colored man. Us'd stay
at church most all day. When we didn' go to church, us'd git together in
the quarters and have preachin' and singin' amongst ourselves.
""In cotton pickin' time us'd stay in de field till way atter dark and
us'd pick by candle light and den carry hit and put hit on de scaffold.
In de winter time us'd quilt; jes' go from one house to anudder in de
quarter. Us'd weave all our ever' day clothes but Marster Lucas'd go to
Mobile ever' July and Christmas and git our Sunday clothes, git us
dresses and shoes and we'd sho be proud of 'em.
""In slavery time dey doctored de sick folks dif'funt frum what dey does
now. I seed a man so sick dey had to put medicine down his tho'at lak he
was a horse. Dat man got well and sho lived to turn a key in de jail. Ef
it was in dese days dat man would be cay'd to de hospital and cut open
lak a hawg.
""Dere was a slave whut lived in Macon county. He run 'way and when he
was catched dey dug a hole in de ground and put him crost it and beat
him nigh to death.""","Interview with Martha Bradley

Interview with Reuben Fitzpatrick
-[HW:
Mabel Farrior, Montgomery, Alabama]
Reuben Fitzpatrick, of Eugene Street, Montgomery, was born Jan. 9, 1854,
(83 years old). He says:
""My Marster was Mister Gholson frum Bullock county. He had lots uv
slaves 'cause he was a rich man. I was jes' a boy ten years ole an' he
was a squire dat tried cases, so he rode all over de country to dif'funt
places. I rode wid him to hole his horse. He wore a high top black hat
and had a buggy wid a top dat let back. When we went we was gone a long
time an' when night come he would fix it fer me to sleep wid some uv de
niggers in de quarters where we stopped. I sho' lacked to go 'bout wid
him.
""My mother was de cook. She had rule over all the cookin'. She spinned
thread an' reeled it off too.
""When de Yankees come through de country I seed 'em all runnin' so I
thought it was jedgment day an' I runned an' hid under de chimney an'
stayed dere 'tel night. Dey didn't tarry long, but dey drove de horses
right up on de piazza, and throwed ever' thing out de houses, eben
knocked down de smoke 'ouse doors. Dat's de trufe'.
""One time I was taken to the slave market and I was screwed on the block
and Mr. Martin bought me and my Mamma. The man that was selling us would
holler, ""Who'll bid? Who'll bid?"" We was supposed to be spry and fidgety
so as to make the men want to buy us. My fust Marster was Wash Jones. He
wan't good to us. He would hit us wid his cane jes' as if it had been a
switch. Ben Jones didn't like the way Marse Wash treated us niggers. He
bought us for his son.
""We didn't have no doctors much in dem days, but us had a horn us use
when we got sick. If us had the headache that horn would go right over
the spot and it wouldn't be no time 'fore the pain'd be gone. We'd use
that horn anytime we was ailing an' it'd sho' do the work. I used to
have the horn but I don't know jes' where it is now.""","Interview with Reuben Fitzpatrick

""Yassuh, I was a slave,"" spoke Aunt Carry from her vine-shaded porch at
No. 3 Sharpe Street, Montgomery, Alabama. ""I was borned in 1849 on Mr.
Will Wright's plantation on the Mt. Meigs road. Massa Will had a big
slave house an' us niggers sho' use to have a good time playin' 'roun'
down at de slave quarters. We had a row of houses two stories high, an'
dey was filled wid all sorts of niggers. When I was twelve year old, I
was made nu'ss fer my mistis's little girl an' at de fus' I couldn't do
nothin' but rock de cradle. I didn't know how to hol' de baby. Us
niggers had gardeens (guardians) dat look 'atter us lak dey did atter de
hosses and cows and pigs.
""One night atter we had all gone to bed I heered a noise at de window,
an' when I look up dere was a man a climbin' in. He was a nigger. I
could tell eben do I could scarce see him, I knowed he was a nigger. I
could hear my mistis a breathin', an' de baby was soun' asleep too. I
started to yell out but I thought dat de nigger would kill us so I jes'
kep' quiet. He come in de window, an' he see us a sleepin' dere, an' all
of a sudden I knowed who it was. 'Jade,' I whispers, 'What you a doin'
here?' He come to my bed and put his rough han' ober my mouf.
""Listen you black pickaninny, you tell em dat you saw me here an' I'll
kill you,' he say, 'I th'ow yo' hide to de snakes in de swamp. Now shet
up.'
""Wid dat he went to de dresser an' taken mistis' money bag. Atter dat he
went to de window an' climb down de ladder an' I didn't do nothin' but
shake myself nearly to death fum fright. De nex' day de oberseer an' de
pattyrollers went a searchin' th'ough de slave quarters an' dey foun' de
money bag under Jade's cot. Dey tuk him an' whupped him for near fifteen
minutes. We could hear him holla way up at de big house. Jade, he neber
got ober dat whuppin'. He died three days later. He was a good nigger,
'peer to me lak, an' de bes' blacksmith in de whole county. I
ke'pa-wonderin' whut made him want ter steal dat purse. Den I foun' out
later dat he was a goin' to pay a white man ter carry him ober de line
to de No'thern States. Jade jus' had too big ideas fo' a nigger. I us'ta
see Jade's ghos' a walkin' out in de garden in de moonlight; sometime he
sit on de fence an' look at his ole cabin, den sometimes he stroll off
down de cotton fiel'. When de Lawd git th'ough a punishin' him fo' a
stealin' dat money, I guess he won't make us no mo' visits. He jus' go
right on in heaben. Dat's what ghos'tes is, you know; peoples dat can't
quite git in heaben, an' dey hadda stroll 'roun' little longer on de
outside repentin'.
""Soon atter dat my gardeen tuk me to Tallasse when de massa died. My
gardeen was a good man. He was always a-makin' speeches fo' de slaves to
stay under bondage till dey was twenty-one. One dey he was in front of a
sto' talkin' 'bout de slaves an' a man come up to him an' said he don't
like de way Capt. Clanton talk (dat was my gardeen's name). Capt.
Clanton ask him whut he goin' ter do 'bout it an' de man tuk out a
pistol an' kil't de Cap'n raght dere on de spot.
""Den I was sold to another man, a Mr. Williamson, 'bout de time de war
broke loose, an' Massa Williamson tuk me ober ter lib wid some mo'
peoples. He said he had mo' slaves dan he could take keer of. Dis was de
Abernathy plantation. While de massa was a standin' in de slave quarters
a takin' to Mr Abernathy, I noticed a boy wid a bad eye. I didn't lak
him at all an' I tol' de massa I don't wanna stay, kaze I didn't lak de
way dat boy Lum wid de bad eye looked at me. Den Mr. Abernathy brung a
boy 'bout sebenteen year old; a big strong lookin' boy named Jeff. He
say 'Jeff, look out after Carry here. Don't let her git into no
trouble.' Fum dat time on till 'bout five year ago, Jeff he always look
after me, kaze atter de war I ma'ied him. Now I ain't got nobody but
myself.""","Interview with Caroline Holland

Interview with Elizabeth Thomas

Montgomery
Elizabeth Thomas who lives at 2 Eugene Street, Montgomery, Alabama stuck
up one finger when asked her age. That meant 100 she said. She is
typical the oldtime Negro with head rag tightly covering her hair,
carrying a slick old walking-stick whose bark is worn in places because
of constant use, and little old straightcut full apron. Her memory is
not clear but her hearing is perfect.
She stated-
""I lived mighty fine in dem days, I tel' you. Mister Ben Martin Jones
was my Marster, and I was born on de Red Bridge Road. I was a house
servant. All our clo'es was made at de quarters. My Mammy made mine an'
all I wanted, too. I useter hear my mammy say, de patteroles (patrols)
would git us ef we done wrong but I didn't know nothin' 'bout
patteroles, 'cause dey wasn't none on our place. Dey whipped you, too,
but my Marster could control all his niggers so he didn't 'low none uv
'em on our place.
""I was 21 years ole when de Yankees come but I didn't run and dey didn't
do nuthin' to me but folks was in such a hurry they hid things dat ain't
never been foun' yet. I liked meetin' on Sundays an' sometime we never
got outer church tell daylight. I wants to live jes' as long as Jesus
say an' when he say go, I'se ready. At Christmas times we always had
good dinners and heap o' company; plenty uv it. My Missus died and atter
dat my mother raised ole Marster's chile, Tommy John, right 'long wid
me. O, dem was happy days, I tell you.""","Interview with Elizabeth Thomas

Interview with Callie Williams
-
Mary A. Poole, Mobile
Callie Williams was only four years old at the time of the surrender,
but stories told to her by her mother are vividly remembered, and the
fact that she has had the same environment continously throughout the
years imprinted these happenings permanently on her mind. She lives at
504 Eslava Street, Mobile.
""My mammy and pappy was brought to Alabama by specalators who sold 'em
to Mr. Hiram McLemore at Newport Landing, on de Alabama ribber,"" Callie
said. ""Mammy's name was Vicey and she was born in Virginia, but my pappy
was born in Kentucky. His name was Harry. Mr. McLemore had about three
hundred head of slaves, some of 'em on one plantation of about two
thousand acres an' de res' on another place of about five hundred acres.
He sho' did have a pretty house. It was all white and ramblin-like and
had big trees aroun' it. Dere was a cool well and a big dairy right
close by it and den de cabins was all in a row in de back, some of 'em
made out of planks, but mos' of 'em was made wid logs. Dey was all named
after whoever lived in 'em.""
Aunt Callie needed little urging to tell of the old days, and she claims
to vividly remember her master's family.
""His wife was named Axie Bethea and he had seven children,"" she said.
""One of 'em I never will forget, Miss Julia, 'case she gimme de first
calico dress I ever had and I was proud as a peacock wid it. Miss Julia
was de oldest little girl and dey give me to her.
""My mammy say dat dey waked up in de mornin' when dey heard de sweep.
Dat was a piece of iron hangin' by a string and it made a loud noise
when it was banged wid another piece of iron. Dey had to get up at four
o'clock and be at work by sunup. To do dis, dey mos' all de time cook
breakfast de night befo'.
""Pappy was a driver under de overseer, but mammy say dat she stay at de
little nursery cabin and look after all de little babies. Dey had a
cabin fixed up with homemade cradles and things where dey put all de
babies. Der mammies would come in from de field about ten o'clock to
nurse 'em and den later in de day, my mammy would feed de youngest on
pot-licker and de older ones on greens and pot-licker. Dey had skimmed
milk and mush, too, and all of 'em stayed as fat as a butter balls, me
among 'em. Mammy saw dat I always got my share.
""De slaves got rations every Monday night. Dere would be three pounds of
meat and a peck of meal. Dere was a big garden dat all of 'em worked and
dey had all de vegetables dey needed and dere was always plenty of
skimmed milk. Dey cooked de meals on open fireplaces in de big iron
'spiders.' Dem was big pots hangin' over the fire from a hook. Dey do de
cookin' at night and den warm it over the nex' day if dey wanted it dat
way.
""While mammy was tendin' de babies she had to spin cotton and she was
supposed to spin two 'cuts' a day. Four 'cuts' was a hard day's work.
What was a cut? You oughta' know dat! Dey had a reel and when it had
spun three hundred yards it popped. Dat was a ""cut."" When it had been
spun, den another woman took it to de loom to make cloth for de slaves.
Dey always took Saturday afternoon to clean up de clothes and cabins,
'case dey always had to start work on Monday mornin' clean as a pin. If
dey didn't, dey got whupped for bein' dirty.
""Some of de niggers, after dey'd been beat, would try to run away and
some of 'em got loose, but de patterollers caught a lot of 'em and den
dey'd get it harder dan ever befo' and have shackles out on dere feet
wid jes' enough slack for 'em to walk so dey could work.
""If dey wanted to go 'possum huntin' or fishin', dey could get passes
from de overseer. Two things dey really loved to eat was 'possum and
fish. Dey'd eat and eat 'till dey'd get sick and den dey'd have to boil
up a dose of Boneset tea to work 'em out. If dat didn't make 'em feel
better, dey'd go to Marster. He always kept calomel, bluemas and quinine
on hand. If dey got too bad off sick, den marster would call de doctor.
De children wasn't bothered with nothin' much but worms and dey'd take
Jerusalem oak. It was de seed of a weed dat cook' and mix' 'lasses to
make it taste like candy. Boneset was a bush and dey'd boil de leaves to
get boneset tea.
""Mos' of de time de slaves would be too tired to do anything but go to
bed at night, but sometimes dey would set around and sing after supper
and dey would sing and pray on Sunday. One of de songs dat was used mos'
was 'Yon Comes Old Marster Jesus.' If I remembers rightly, it went
somp'n' like dis:
I really believe Christ is comin' again
He's comin' in de mornin'
He's comin' in de mornin'
He's comin' wid a rainbow on his shoulder
He's comin' again bye and bye.
""Dey tried to make 'em stop singin' and prayin' durin' de war, 'case all
dey'd ask for was to be sot free, but de slaves would get in de cabins
and turn a big wash pot upside down and sing into dat, and de noise
couldn't get out. I don't remember nothin' about dis ceptin' what mammy
say.
""When de Surrender come, she say dat a whole regiment of soldiers rode
up to de house yellin' to de niggers dat dey was free. Den de soldiers
took de meat out of de smokehouse and got all de 'lasses and meal and
give it all to de niggers. Dey robbed de bees and den dey eat dinner
and go on to de nex' place, takin' de menfolks wid 'em, all 'ceptin' de
ones too old, my pappy among 'em.
""After it was all over my pappy rented land on Mr. McLemore's place and
he and mammy stayed dere till dey died. Dey was buried in de same
graveyard dat Mr. McLemore had set aside for his slaves. I married Frank
Williams in Montgomery, Alabama, but our marriage was nothin' like mammy
say her and pappy's was. She say dey 'jumped de broom stick.' When any
of de slaves wanted to get married dey would go to de big house and tell
marster and he'd get his broomstick and say, 'Harry, does you want
Vicey?' And Harry would say 'yes.' Den Marster would say, 'Vicey, does
you want Harry?', and she say 'yes.' Den marster say, 'Jine hands and
jump de broomstick and you is married. De ceremony wasn't much but dey
stuck lots closer den, and you didn't hear about so many divorces and
such as dat.
""All my children is dead but two. I had five. One is livin' in Atlantic
City, N.J., and I live here wid de other one. I 'spects I'll jes' go on
livin' here 'till I die, serving Ole Marster as bes' I can. If all de
peoples on dis here earth would do dat, we wouldn't be pestered wid all
dese here troubles like we is nowadays.","Interview with Callie Williams

Interview with Callie Williams
-
Mary A. Poole, Mobile
Callie Williams was only four years old at the time of the surrender,
but stories told to her by her mother are vividly remembered, and the
fact that she has had the same environment continously throughout the
years imprinted these happenings permanently on her mind. She lives at
504 Eslava Street, Mobile.
""My mammy and pappy was brought to Alabama by specalators who sold 'em
to Mr. Hiram McLemore at Newport Landing, on de Alabama ribber,"" Callie
said. ""Mammy's name was Vicey and she was born in Virginia, but my pappy
was born in Kentucky. His name was Harry. Mr. McLemore had about three
hundred head of slaves, some of 'em on one plantation of about two
thousand acres an' de res' on another place of about five hundred acres.
He sho' did have a pretty house. It was all white and ramblin-like and
had big trees aroun' it. Dere was a cool well and a big dairy right
close by it and den de cabins was all in a row in de back, some of 'em
made out of planks, but mos' of 'em was made wid logs. Dey was all named
after whoever lived in 'em.""
Aunt Callie needed little urging to tell of the old days, and she claims
to vividly remember her master's family.
""His wife was named Axie Bethea and he had seven children,"" she said.
""One of 'em I never will forget, Miss Julia, 'case she gimme de first
calico dress I ever had and I was proud as a peacock wid it. Miss Julia
was de oldest little girl and dey give me to her.
""My mammy say dat dey waked up in de mornin' when dey heard de sweep.
Dat was a piece of iron hangin' by a string and it made a loud noise
when it was banged wid another piece of iron. Dey had to get up at four
o'clock and be at work by sunup. To do dis, dey mos' all de time cook
breakfast de night befo'.
""Pappy was a driver under de overseer, but mammy say dat she stay at de
little nursery cabin and look after all de little babies. Dey had a
cabin fixed up with homemade cradles and things where dey put all de
babies. Der mammies would come in from de field about ten o'clock to
nurse 'em and den later in de day, my mammy would feed de youngest on
pot-licker and de older ones on greens and pot-licker. Dey had skimmed
milk and mush, too, and all of 'em stayed as fat as a butter balls, me
among 'em. Mammy saw dat I always got my share.
""De slaves got rations every Monday night. Dere would be three pounds of
meat and a peck of meal. Dere was a big garden dat all of 'em worked and
dey had all de vegetables dey needed and dere was always plenty of
skimmed milk. Dey cooked de meals on open fireplaces in de big iron
'spiders.' Dem was big pots hangin' over the fire from a hook. Dey do de
cookin' at night and den warm it over the nex' day if dey wanted it dat
way.
""While mammy was tendin' de babies she had to spin cotton and she was
supposed to spin two 'cuts' a day. Four 'cuts' was a hard day's work.
What was a cut? You oughta' know dat! Dey had a reel and when it had
spun three hundred yards it popped. Dat was a ""cut."" When it had been
spun, den another woman took it to de loom to make cloth for de slaves.
Dey always took Saturday afternoon to clean up de clothes and cabins,
'case dey always had to start work on Monday mornin' clean as a pin. If
dey didn't, dey got whupped for bein' dirty.
""Some of de niggers, after dey'd been beat, would try to run away and
some of 'em got loose, but de patterollers caught a lot of 'em and den
dey'd get it harder dan ever befo' and have shackles out on dere feet
wid jes' enough slack for 'em to walk so dey could work.
""If dey wanted to go 'possum huntin' or fishin', dey could get passes
from de overseer. Two things dey really loved to eat was 'possum and
fish. Dey'd eat and eat 'till dey'd get sick and den dey'd have to boil
up a dose of Boneset tea to work 'em out. If dat didn't make 'em feel
better, dey'd go to Marster. He always kept calomel, bluemas and quinine
on hand. If dey got too bad off sick, den marster would call de doctor.
De children wasn't bothered with nothin' much but worms and dey'd take
Jerusalem oak. It was de seed of a weed dat cook' and mix' 'lasses to
make it taste like candy. Boneset was a bush and dey'd boil de leaves to
get boneset tea.
""Mos' of de time de slaves would be too tired to do anything but go to
bed at night, but sometimes dey would set around and sing after supper
and dey would sing and pray on Sunday. One of de songs dat was used mos'
was 'Yon Comes Old Marster Jesus.' If I remembers rightly, it went
somp'n' like dis:
I really believe Christ is comin' again
He's comin' in de mornin'
He's comin' in de mornin'
He's comin' wid a rainbow on his shoulder
He's comin' again bye and bye.
""Dey tried to make 'em stop singin' and prayin' durin' de war, 'case all
dey'd ask for was to be sot free, but de slaves would get in de cabins
and turn a big wash pot upside down and sing into dat, and de noise
couldn't get out. I don't remember nothin' about dis ceptin' what mammy
say.
""When de Surrender come, she say dat a whole regiment of soldiers rode
up to de house yellin' to de niggers dat dey was free. Den de soldiers
took de meat out of de smokehouse and got all de 'lasses and meal and
give it all to de niggers. Dey robbed de bees and den dey eat dinner
and go on to de nex' place, takin' de menfolks wid 'em, all 'ceptin' de
ones too old, my pappy among 'em.
""After it was all over my pappy rented land on Mr. McLemore's place and
he and mammy stayed dere till dey died. Dey was buried in de same
graveyard dat Mr. McLemore had set aside for his slaves. I married Frank
Williams in Montgomery, Alabama, but our marriage was nothin' like mammy
say her and pappy's was. She say dey 'jumped de broom stick.' When any
of de slaves wanted to get married dey would go to de big house and tell
marster and he'd get his broomstick and say, 'Harry, does you want
Vicey?' And Harry would say 'yes.' Den Marster would say, 'Vicey, does
you want Harry?', and she say 'yes.' Den marster say, 'Jine hands and
jump de broomstick and you is married. De ceremony wasn't much but dey
stuck lots closer den, and you didn't hear about so many divorces and
such as dat.
""All my children is dead but two. I had five. One is livin' in Atlantic
City, N.J., and I live here wid de other one. I 'spects I'll jes' go on
livin' here 'till I die, serving Ole Marster as bes' I can. If all de
peoples on dis here earth would do dat, we wouldn't be pestered wid all
dese here troubles like we is nowadays.","Interview with Callie Williams

Interview with Bert Frederick

""Wants my friends to go wid me, New Jerusalem;
Wonder ef I'll ever git to heaven, New Jerusalem!""
Nappy-headed, humble little Bert Frederick sang the old song in a voice
that trembled and broke on the high notes. His black face beamed when he
had finished, and ""de old times"" came flooding back into his mind.
""Honey, Ol' Master us'ta sing dat good song to us niggers; an' he allus
could sing it so purty.""
Uncle Frederick, like all the other gray-bearded Negroes of the Old
South, is occupied mostly these days with getting ready to meet ""de
Sweet Jesus."" As well as he can remember, he was around 12 years old
when ""de hawn of freedom sounded.""
He shook his white head when the interviewer asked his age, a slow smile
spreading over his face.
""Honey chile, you's axed me a riddle. I disremember 'bout dat. De bes' I
kin till you is dat I is eighty-odd-but as to 'zackness, I can't tell.""
Some years ago, Uncle Frederick suffered a broken back in an accident.
Since then he has been unable to stand erect, but can straighten his
back when seated. Therefore, he politely asked to sit down when he was
asked to pose for a picture.
His first master, he says, was Dr. Rich Vernon, who lived in Chambers
County. Afterward, he was sold to William Frederick.
He chuckled as he recalled the old days.
""I was a shirt-tail nigger,"" he laughed. ""Dat is, I wore jes' a long
shirt 'twel I was a big scamp more dan twelve year old. Honey, I was a
sight to look at!
""Whut did I do about de plantation? Well, I driv de cows an' sheep to
pasture an' seed dat no eagles kotched de lambs. Us had big eagles
'roun' den, an' us had to be keerful wid de small stock. Ef us warn't,
ol' eagle ud swoop down an' tote off a whole lamb.
""Us had a time in dem days. I 'members dat us had a pen to ketch wild
turkeys in. An' us kotched a few of dem, too.""
Uncle Frederick's mother was Harriett Lumpkin, who lived below Opelika.
He had three sisters, Mary Dowdell, Anne Carlisle and Emma Boyd; but all
are dead.
Bert Frederick, Opelika, Alabama
""When de Yankees come to Alabama,"" he recalled, ""Ol' Master tol' de
niggers to hitch up all de wagons an' load all de food an' sech on 'em.
Us had 'bout forty acres of swamp land, so us hid de stuff dere.
""'Fore long I seed a long string of black an' white horses, wid mules
behin' dem. Dey had packs on dey back. In de packs was grub de Yankees
had tuk off'en de white peoples.""
""Did you enjoy the old slavery days, Uncle?""
""Yes, chile, dey was good days. Some of de white peoples was bad to de
niggers, but my Ol' Master warn't dat kind. Dat de reason he would let
all de niggers sit aroun' whilst he was a singin'; an' he could sing.""
Uncle Frederick putters about his tiny home in Opelika, managing to grow
a profusion of flowers and vegetables despite his bent back. He was
hoeing in his garden when the interviewer came upon him, but he eagerly
laid down the hoe when told what he sought.
""Uncle, I want to talk with you about the old times.""
""Lordy me, chile,"" he beamed, his eyes twinkling, ""you done foun' de
raght nigger!""","Interview with Bert Frederick

Interview with Jane Holloway

Jane Holloway was ill. For weeks she had been in bed, and the untidy
condition of her cabin brought profuse apologies when I entered.
""Jane, do you remember me?"" I asked.
""I don't know, honey. I been sick so long wid de fluse I can't 'member
much of anything,"" she answered peering up at me from her pillow.
Suddenly she smiled, ""Shucks. Co'se I 'members you, honey. Your daddy
sho' was good to my boys. Watt worked for him so long. Res' yourself in
dat cheer and I'll tell you all about myself and slavery times what I
can recollect.
""I'se all alone now 'ceppen for my grandson. He ain't but
twelve and he can't ho'p much. But I guess I got no right to complain
I guess I done got me plenty outa life.
""I was borned up in North Alabama. My mammy was Carrie Holloway and my
pappy was Traylor Holloway. I had a brother Maryland. Dere nebber was
but de two of us. Us lived in a mud and log house, jes' one room but it
sho' had a big fireplace. Us had a good old time den, effen us jes' had
knowed it, 'caze us was always fed good. Dey had long wooden troughs
what dey poured our bread and milk in and us eat it wid a wooden spoon.
When dey yell, 'Chillun, chillun! Bread!' you bet we jes' burnt de wind
getting dere, 'caze us was always hongry.
""We had high tester beds in all de houses, what was 'bout a mile from de
Big House. It had four rooms and was all planked up. Mr. Billy Taylor
was mighty good to his niggers. He didn't have so many slaves, he jes'
had a little plantation. Our oberseer was good, too. He had to whip
some of dem sometimes, but dey wouldn't work. Dey brung it all on
deyselves.
Jane Holloway, Opelika, Alabama
""When de Yankees come enduring de war, de men come arunning and a
screaming dat de Yankees coming. And dey did come on horseback and took
all our provisions what was in de smokehouse. Dey took everything we had
in de way of victuals and stock, too.
""I j'ined de church when I was ten years old, 'caze I was trying to live
right and do what de Bible said. De white folks had deir services in de
morning, and in de evening would let us niggers have ourn.""
Jane forgot her misery long enough to come out to the porch of her
comparatively comfortable cabin and she was ""plumb proud"" to have her
""picture took.""","Interview with Jane Holloway

Uncle Everett Ingram mused: ""Honey chile, my gran'mammy was de beatenest
woman to have chilluns dat you ever seen. I has hyared dat she raised so
many of dem dat she brung a mighty heap on de block; somewhere near a
thousan' dollars.""
Uncle Everett is a familiar figure in East Opelika, where he has lived
for years. He was ""a right good-sized scamp at freedom time"" and
remembers much of what he has seen and heard. He was born in Russell
County, the son of Prince and Fanny Ingram. They had seven other
children; Jerry, Clara, Rubin, Jep, Lula, Eugene and Lucy.
Everett says of his life:
""Our house in de slave settlement was made of logs an' had one room. It
had a mud an' stick chimney, a plank floor an' a boxed-up bed wid one
leg at de foot. De mattress was stuffed wid shucks an' straw.
""My gran'pappy, Prince Walden, an' Lucy, his wife, come from Russell
County, too, an' belonged to de Covingtons. Later dey was sold to Dr.
Walden, at Uchie. When dey come to Uchie de county was full of Indians.
My gran'pappy useta drink likker wid 'em; but gran'ma, she was skeered
an' runned away to Columbus, Georgy. On her way dere, my mammy was
borned in de woods.
""I 'members dat when I was a strip of a boy, dey cooked ash-cake on
leaves an' de chilluns et pot-licker an' bread an' greens outen wooden
trays wid wooden spoons. Dey would sit under de trees an' eat. Each
family had dey own bowl, an' us et a-plenty, too. In cold weather mammy
kept all de chilluns in de house by de fire.
""Master had us a two-room house, 'ca'se my mammy was de cook an' weaver.
Dey made dey own silk den, too, an' raised de silk worms. Us useta get
mulberry leaves to feed de silk worms wid. Us used indigo, which us
cooked an' used for dye. Us would wear any kind of clothes on everyday
an' Sunday; an' didn't have no shoes 'til us was big chilluns.
""Ol' Marster an' Ol' Mistus, Mr. Bill an' Miss Lucy Ingram, lived in a
big weather-boarded house wid a wide hall an' a chimney at each end. De
kitchen was off from de rest of de house.
""I 'members dat de overseer useta whip mammy an' pappy, 'ca'se dey fight
so much. He useta take my mammy to de carriage to whip her. Marster was
in de war den. When he come home, de overseer tuk mammy by de han' to de
house an' tell Marster 'bout havin' to whip her. He'd jest shake his
head, sad-lak. He was mighty good to all of us.
""My gran'pappy was put in de speculator drove, put on de block an' sold.
""I 'members dat Mistus read de Bible to us an' my mammy was converted by
de white preacher. He baptized her. De colored folks used de white
church an' set in de back.
""An' honey, dey shorely did have good times dancin' on Sattidy nights;
an' sometimes dey would dance 'till Sunday mornin'. When de corn needed
shuckln', it was hauled up near de crib, an' on a purty moonlighted
night Marster would pass 'roun' de likker. It wouldn't be long 'til dey
was all happy an' had what dey called a general. De general led all de
hollers an' songs. Dey shorely did get dat corn shucked fast, too.
""Gran'mammy was a great doctor; useta give us turpentine an' castor oil
an' Jerusalem oak fer worms. She'd give us all kinds of teas, too. I
'members dat gran'mammy was also a midwife.
Everett Ingram, Opelika, Alabama
""De Yankees comed through de yard in May an' tol' us: 'You's free.' De
Yankees wasn't so good. Dey hung my mammy up in de smokehouse by her
thumbs; tips of her toes jest touchin' de floor, 'ca'se she wouldn't
'gree to give up her older chilluns. She never did, neither.
""Daddy stole both de older chilluns, dough, an' went off. De Yankees
stole provisions an' stock an' hauled 'em off. De news got to Uchie an'
everybody hid out; Marster wid 'em. Dey hunted de money whut was hid in
de colored folks beds; nearly $2,000. De jewelry was dere, too. Dey
foun' some money at de big house an' said: 'Dis money ain't worth a
damn;' but dey tuk it jest de same.
""I married Hattie Graves. Den I j'ined de church an' was
saved.""","Interview with Everett Ingram

Interview with Everett Ingram

Preston Klein, Opelika, Alabama
Uncle Everett Ingram mused: ""Honey chile, my gran'mammy was de beatenest
woman to have chilluns dat you ever seen. I has hyared dat she raised so
many of dem dat she brung a mighty heap on de block; somewhere near a
thousan' dollars.""
Uncle Everett is a familiar figure in East Opelika, where he has lived
for years. He was ""a right good-sized scamp at freedom time"" and
remembers much of what he has seen and heard. He was born in Russell
County, the son of Prince and Fanny Ingram. They had seven other
children; Jerry, Clara, Rubin, Jep, Lula, Eugene and Lucy.
Everett says of his life:
""Our house in de slave settlement was made of logs an' had one room. It
had a mud an' stick chimney, a plank floor an' a boxed-up bed wid one
leg at de foot. De mattress was stuffed wid shucks an' straw.
""My gran'pappy, Prince Walden, an' Lucy, his wife, come from Russell
County, too, an' belonged to de Covingtons. Later dey was sold to Dr.
Walden, at Uchie. When dey come to Uchie de county was full of Indians.
My gran'pappy useta drink likker wid 'em; but gran'ma, she was skeered
an' runned away to Columbus, Georgy. On her way dere, my mammy was
borned in de woods.
""I 'members dat when I was a strip of a boy, dey cooked ash-cake on
leaves an' de chilluns et pot-licker an' bread an' greens outen wooden
trays wid wooden spoons. Dey would sit under de trees an' eat. Each
family had dey own bowl, an' us et a-plenty, too. In cold weather mammy
kept all de chilluns in de house by de fire.
""Master had us a two-room house, 'ca'se my mammy was de cook an' weaver.
Dey made dey own silk den, too, an' raised de silk worms. Us useta get
mulberry leaves to feed de silk worms wid. Us used indigo, which us
cooked an' used for dye. Us would wear any kind of clothes on everyday
an' Sunday; an' didn't have no shoes 'til us was big chilluns.
""Ol' Marster an' Ol' Mistus, Mr. Bill an' Miss Lucy Ingram, lived in a
big weather-boarded house wid a wide hall an' a chimney at each end. De
kitchen was off from de rest of de house.
""I 'members dat de overseer useta whip mammy an' pappy, 'ca'se dey fight
so much. He useta take my mammy to de carriage to whip her. Marster was
in de war den. When he come home, de overseer tuk mammy by de han' to de
house an' tell Marster 'bout havin' to whip her. He'd jest shake his
head, sad-lak. He was mighty good to all of us.
""My gran'pappy was put in de speculator drove, put on de block an' sold.
""I 'members dat Mistus read de Bible to us an' my mammy was converted by
de white preacher. He baptized her. De colored folks used de white
church an' set in de back.
""An' honey, dey shorely did have good times dancin' on Sattidy nights;
an' sometimes dey would dance 'till Sunday mornin'. When de corn needed
shuckln', it was hauled up near de crib, an' on a purty moonlighted
night Marster would pass 'roun' de likker. It wouldn't be long 'til dey
was all happy an' had what dey called a general. De general led all de
hollers an' songs. Dey shorely did get dat corn shucked fast, too.
""Gran'mammy was a great doctor; useta give us turpentine an' castor oil
an' Jerusalem oak fer worms. She'd give us all kinds of teas, too. I
'members dat gran'mammy was also a midwife.
Everett Ingram, Opelika, Alabama
""De Yankees comed through de yard in May an' tol' us: 'You's free.' De
Yankees wasn't so good. Dey hung my mammy up in de smokehouse by her
thumbs; tips of her toes jest touchin' de floor, 'ca'se she wouldn't
'gree to give up her older chilluns. She never did, neither.
""Daddy stole both de older chilluns, dough, an' went off. De Yankees
stole provisions an' stock an' hauled 'em off. De news got to Uchie an'
everybody hid out; Marster wid 'em. Dey hunted de money whut was hid in
de colored folks beds; nearly $2,000. De jewelry was dere, too. Dey
foun' some money at de big house an' said: 'Dis money ain't worth a
damn;' but dey tuk it jest de same.
""I married Hattie Graves. Den I j'ined de church an' was
saved.""","Interview with Everett Ingram

Interview with Anne Maddox

Preston Klein, Opelika
Bible records place Anne Maddox's age at 113. She lives in a tiny cabin
with her youngest child, Zora, about eight miles from Opelika. She is
very feeble now and had to be wheeled out on the front porch to have her
picture made.
Anne lives exclusively in the past. To her, the present world is ""full
of de devil an' gettin' worser every day."" She likes to talk about the
old days, but her voice is feeble and barely above a whisper.
""I'se heerd a heap o' talk 'bout Mr. Abraham Lincoln,"" she said, ""an' I
had a picture of him onc't; but I don't know nothin' 'bout him.""
Anne takes her religion seriously and is devoutly confident that she
will ""inherit de promise.""
""I jined de church in Gold Hill, Alabama,"" she recalled, ""an' honey, I
felt so good I don't know jest how I did feel. I shouted three days an'
wouldn't eat a bite. I couldn't even drink water.""
The old former slave was born in Virginia in 1824 and belonged to John
Umford. She was later sold to Bill Maddox, of Alabama.
""When I come from Virginny,"" she said, ""us travelled in wagons and slept
in tents. Eve'y mornin' us was made to clean ourselves an' dress up; den
us was put on de block an' bid on. White peoples was dere from
everywhere; de face of de earth was covered by dem. I was thirteen den,
an' I kin remember four wars.
""My mother and father was Charlie an' Rhody Heath, an' I had two
brothers an' two sisters. Our houses was lak horse stables; made of logs
wid mud an' sticks dobbed in de cracks. Dey had no floors. Dere warn't
no furniture 'cept a box fer de dresser wid a piece of looking glass to
look in. Us had to sleep on shuck mattresses an' us cooked on big
fireplaces wid long hooks out over de fire to hang pots on to bile.
Anne Maddox, Opelika, Alabama
""Us fried on three-legged skillets over de fire an' cooked ash-cakes on
de hearth wid hickory leaves on de bottom nex' to de hearth. 'Tain't no
sech good cookin' now as den.
""'Bout four o'clock in de evenin' all de little niggers was called up in
de big yard where de cook had put milk in a long wooden trough an'
crumbled ash-cake in it. Us had pot licker in de trough, too. Us et de
bread an' milk wid shells an' would use our hands, but it was good.
""Ol' Marster hunted a heap, but us never did git none of what he brought
in. Us had plenty of clothes, sich as was, but dey was spun an' wove at
home. Us had home-made shoes, hard brogans, called 'Jackson ties.' Dey
had brass caps on de toe an' would rub blisters on de feet.
""De plantation had several hundred acres. I was up wid de fust light to
draw water and help as house girl. When dat task was done I had to go to
de fiel'. Dey blew a big hawn to 'rouse de slaves in de morning's,
sometimes 'fore day.
""Marster was good to us niggers, dough. He never 'lowed us to
be whupped; jist scolded us. If us went anywheres, us had to be back
by sundown. I once seed some slaves workin' roads in chains wid a
iron ball hangin' on behin'. It was punishment fur meanness.""
Anne said the slaves on the Maddox plantation were never allowed to
learn to read and write, declaring: ""It was too bad if dey kotched a
nigger wid a pencil an' paper in his han!""
""I was made to carry Marster's chilluns to school, den go back fur 'em,""
she said. ""Ol' Mistus read us de Bible, an' us went to de white folks
church an' sat in de back, wid de white peoples sittin' up front.
""Oh, dem patterollers was bad. I sho' would run from dem things, too.""
Anne's mind leaps in fast succession from one subject to another, and at
times it is difficult to keep up with her intermingled thoughts.
""Ol' Marster give us plenty of licker,"" she said, ""an' us laked dat. One
of de funniest things us had aroun' de plantation was a little goat dat
could walk a fence jist lak us little niggers.
""When de Yankees come, gran'daddy was at prayer meetin' an' Ol' Marster
come runnin' an' told de niggers to hitch up de mules an' waggins. Dey
was tol' to hide all de food an' jewelry, but 'bout dat time us seed de
Yankees comin'. Dey didn't do us no harm; sho' did some places, dough.
""T'want long 'fore Marster call all us niggers up to de house an' tol'
us dat us was free. He said us could go away or stay wid him. I stayed
'twel I was grown an' married Doc Maddox. Us had five chillun, Walter,
Failer, Siney, Zora an' Johnny. I don't know how many gran'chilluns I'se
got.""","Interview with Anne Maddox

Interview with Molly Parker
-
Preston Klein, Opelika, Alabama
Down in lower Lee County I found Molly Parker, an old acquaintance,
ailing, and with the wandering mind of the aged. She could find answers
to some of my questions, but some she couldn't get straight. She was
just as clean and neat as she had always been, clad in an apron dress
that she would call a ""Mother Huggard.""
Molly is eighty-five years old and lives with her sister Edna in a
simple cabin, with a little patch of flowers between it and the field
where Edna is still young enough to work. Molly was a housewife's
treasure in the days gone by, but now she is too feeble to do more than
work her little patch of flowers.
Molly Parker, Lee County, Alabama
She was born in Virginia but was brought to Alabama when a child and
sold to a Mr. Dunn, near Salem. Her mother and father were John and
Fanny, the parents of four children, Molly, Edna, Sam and Albert.
""I was a big size housegirl, but I sho' could work,"" Molly recalled.
""Mr. Digby blowed a big bugle early every morning to get us all up and
going by bright light. Mr. Digby was a good overseer and treated all de
slaves de best he knew how.
""I married Dick Parker on a Sunday and dey fixed us a big dinner wid
more good things to eat, but I was too happy to eat much myself. I ain't
had no chillun of my own, but I ho'ped mammy with hern.
""De Yankees done camped nigh our house, and I had to help cook and tote
de grub down to 'em. Us read in de free paper 'bout us being free. Massa
didn't tell us nothing, but us stayed on for a long time atter dat.
Massa had a passel of slaves.
""Yes'm, I'se a member of de church. Why I jined? Jest for protection, I
reckon.
""I'd hate to see slavery time ag'in, 'cause hit sho' was bad for some of
de niggers, but us fared good though.""","Interview with Molly Parker

Interview with Molly Parker

Preston Klein, Opelika, Alabama
Down in lower Lee County I found Molly Parker, an old acquaintance,
ailing, and with the wandering mind of the aged. She could find answers
to some of my questions, but some she couldn't get straight. She was
just as clean and neat as she had always been, clad in an apron dress
that she would call a ""Mother Huggard.""
Molly is eighty-five years old and lives with her sister Edna in a
simple cabin, with a little patch of flowers between it and the field
where Edna is still young enough to work. Molly was a housewife's
treasure in the days gone by, but now she is too feeble to do more than
work her little patch of flowers.
Molly Parker, Lee County, Alabama
She was born in Virginia but was brought to Alabama when a child and
sold to a Mr. Dunn, near Salem. Her mother and father were John and
Fanny, the parents of four children, Molly, Edna, Sam and Albert.
""I was a big size housegirl, but I sho' could work,"" Molly recalled.
""Mr. Digby blowed a big bugle early every morning to get us all up and
going by bright light. Mr. Digby was a good overseer and treated all de
slaves de best he knew how.
""I married Dick Parker on a Sunday and dey fixed us a big dinner wid
more good things to eat, but I was too happy to eat much myself. I ain't
had no chillun of my own, but I ho'ped mammy with hern.
""De Yankees done camped nigh our house, and I had to help cook and tote
de grub down to 'em. Us read in de free paper 'bout us being free. Massa
didn't tell us nothing, but us stayed on for a long time atter dat.
Massa had a passel of slaves.
""Yes'm, I'se a member of de church. Why I jined? Jest for protection, I
reckon.
""I'd hate to see slavery time ag'in, 'cause hit sho' was bad for some of
de niggers, but us fared good though.""","Interview with Molly Parker

""I don't know 'zackly whar I was born,"" said Aunt Roxy Pitts, ""but it

started, dat Ole Marster said I was born. How ole dat make me?
Eighty-two, gwine on eighty-t'ree? Dat's right, en I be eighty-t'ree
year ole dis time nex' year, iffen I lives.
""Yassum, I goes to church putty reg'lar, iffen it don't rain; coz de
rain makes de mizry in my hip en lays me up. I belongs to de Baptis'
church en was baptize wid Jesus when I was twelve year ole. I'se a
foot-washin' Baptis', I is, but dey ain't none of dem kind er Baptis'
'roun' here, en I jes goes wid de udder Baptis' en sets in de amen
corner, en iffen I wants to shout, I shouts, en nobody ain't gonner stop
me, bless the Lord!
""My fu'st marster was name Sam Jones, but I don't 'member him. My udder

a little town name Limekiln. My mammy was part Injun, en Ole marster
cudden' keep her home ner workin' needer; she alluz runnin' off an stay

said she gone whar de Injuns is. Dat was atter de wah, en pappy had to
raise dat little bitsy baby hisse'f. He tuk it en me to de fiel' whar he

gib de baby when it cry. Den Pappy he mai'ed Aunt Josie en dey had er
whole passel er chilluns, en dey was my brudders en sisters.
""'Member 'bout de wah? Sho', I 'members 'bout de wah; but us don't hab
no wah whar us was. Ole Marster got kilt in Virginny, dey said, en he
didn't nebber come back home, en dem what did come back was all crippled

en dey tuk all us's co'n en didn't lef' us nuddin' to eat in de
smokehouse. Dey runned off all de chickens dey cudden ketch, en jes' fo'
dey lef', de ole rooster flewed up on de fence 'hine de orchard en crow:
'IS-DE-YANKEES-G-O-N-E-E'? En de guinea settin' on de lot fence, say:
'Not Yit, Not Yit,' en de ole drake what was hid under de house, he say:
'Hush-h-h, Hush-h-h.'
""Us chilluns sho was misch'us. One time, atter a big rain, us foun' two
hens swimmin' aroun' in de tater house, en us tuk en helt em under de
water twel' dey's done drownded dead, en we tuk 'em to Mammy en she

us went under de flo' en riz up a plank en got in de kitchen en stole
one ob dem chickens outen de pot en et it smack up. When Mammy foun' dat
chicken gone, she tuk er brush broom an wo' us plum out. But us didn't
keer; de brush broom didn't hurt nigh lak de chickens taste good."" Aunt
Roxy nodded her head and rocked back and forth, as if she enjoyed
recalling those youthful escapades.
""Yassum, I kin see plenty good enough to sew, cep'n' I can't tread de
needle, en I has to keep atter dese triflin' chilluns to he'p me. You

""I don't know 'zackly whar I was born,"" said Aunt Roxy Pitts, ""but it

started, dat Ole Marster said I was born. How ole dat make me?
Eighty-two, gwine on eighty-t'ree? Dat's right, en I be eighty-t'ree
year ole dis time nex' year, iffen I lives.
""Yassum, I goes to church putty reg'lar, iffen it don't rain; coz de
rain makes de mizry in my hip en lays me up. I belongs to de Baptis'
church en was baptize wid Jesus when I was twelve year ole. I'se a
foot-washin' Baptis', I is, but dey ain't none of dem kind er Baptis'
'roun' here, en I jes goes wid de udder Baptis' en sets in de amen
corner, en iffen I wants to shout, I shouts, en nobody ain't gonner stop
me, bless the Lord!
""My fu'st marster was name Sam Jones, but I don't 'member him. My udder
marster, de one what I 'members, was name Sam Peg, en us lived clost to
a little town name Limekiln. My mammy was part Injun, en Ole marster
cudden' keep her home ner workin' needer; she alluz runnin' off an stay

said she gone whar de Injuns is. Dat was atter de wah, en pappy had to
raise dat little bitsy baby hisse'f. He tuk it en me to de fiel' whar he

gib de baby when it cry. Den Pappy he mai'ed Aunt Josie en dey had er
whole passel er chilluns, en dey was my brudders en sisters.
""'Member 'bout de wah? Sho', I 'members 'bout de wah; but us don't hab
no wah whar us was. Ole Marster got kilt in Virginny, dey said, en he
didn't nebber come back home, en dem what did come back was all crippled
up an hurt. Us didn't see no Yankees 'twel dey come along atter de wah
was gone, en dey tuk Ole Mistis' good hosses en lef' some po' ole mules,
en dey tuk all us's co'n en didn't lef' us nuddin' to eat in de
smokehouse. Dey runned off all de chickens dey cudden ketch, en jes' fo'
dey lef', de ole rooster flewed up on de fence 'hine de orchard en crow:
'IS-DE-YANKEES-G-O-N-E-E'? En de guinea settin' on de lot fence, say:
'Not Yit, Not Yit,' en de ole drake what was hid under de house, he say:
'Hush-h-h, Hush-h-h.'
""Us chilluns sho was misch'us. One time, atter a big rain, us foun' two
hens swimmin' aroun' in de tater house, en us tuk en helt em under de
water twel' dey's done drownded dead, en we tuk 'em to Mammy en she

us went under de flo' en riz up a plank en got in de kitchen en stole
one ob dem chickens outen de pot en et it smack up. When Mammy foun' dat
chicken gone, she tuk er brush broom an wo' us plum out. But us didn't
keer; de brush broom didn't hurt nigh lak de chickens taste good."" Aunt
Roxy nodded her head and rocked back and forth, as if she enjoyed
recalling those youthful escapades.
""Yassum, I kin see plenty good enough to sew, cep'n' I can't tread de
needle, en I has to keep atter dese triflin' chilluns to he'p me. You

Interview with Cornelia Robinson

""One time I 'members a storm us had. I calls it a harricane; but it was
really de Yankees comin' through.""
Quaint, little Cornelia Robinson was anxious to give all the facts she
could remember about slavery days; but she was only about four years old
during the latter days of that period, and must depend a great deal on
what has been told her.
""Chile, dem Yankees come through an' cleaned out de smokehouse; even
lef' de lard bucket as clean as yo' hand. Ol' Marster tuk his bes'
horses an' mules to de big swamp, an' de Yankees couldn't fin' 'em. But
dey tore up everything dey couldn't take wid dem. Dey poured all de
syrup out an' it run down de road lak water.
""One pore little nigger boy was so skeered dat when he went out to git
up de cows an' when he couldn't fin' some of 'em, he laid down in a
hollow stump an' nearly froze to death. Dey had to thaw him out in de
branch, but he was powerful sick. He war'nt no 'count for nothin' atter
dat.
""I 'members dat Ol' Mistus saved all her jewels an' sech frum de
Yankees. She brung 'em out to de nigger cabins an' hid 'em amongst us.""
Cornelia, forever smiling, wears her gray hair in two short braids down
the back. She says her father and mother were George and Harriett
Yancey, who belonged first to a Mrs. Baugh and who were later sold to a
Dr. Trammell, of near Lafayette. Her brothers and sisters were Charlie,
Willie, Albert and Ann.

""I 'members de high, four-poster beds us useter sometimes sleep on,"" she
said. ""I was so little dat I had to crawl into 'em wid de help of a
stool. I 'members dat de mud fireplaces of early times was far back,
deep an' wide. All de little niggers was fed milk an' bread, wid de
bread crumbled in. Us also had pot licker an' greens.
""Our clothes was muslin an' calico for de hot weather; an' den in winter
us had linty cloth, part wool an' part cotton, homespun. Us raised de
sheep, too, but us didn't wear no clothes hardly in hot weather.
""Us sho' did have a good marster an' mistis. Dey give us all de clothes
an' food us needed an' gived us medicine. Us wore asafetida an' pennies
aroun' our necks to help us not to git sick.
""Dey taught my mother to read an' write, too. Not many done dat. She'd
read de Bible to us little niggers an' give prayers. Atter slavery, us
had schools. I 'members dat George Hawkins an' his wife taught it.""
Cornelia recalls some of the happenings of slavery times.
""If de slaves went off de plantation widout a pass, de patterollers
would ketch 'em an' beat 'em powerful bad. If de niggers could outrun de
patterollers an' git home fust dey couldn't be whupped. Dey had dogs
called 'nigger hounds', same like dey had bird dogs, an' dey would track
de slaves an' bring dem back home.
""I 'members my mother goin' to corn shuckin's. 'Course dey put us little
niggers to bed 'fore dey went but dey sho' sounded lak dey was havin' a
big time, hollerin' an' singin'. Us went to de white folks church in de
afternoon, an' de Reverend Gardner was a mighty good preacher. When any
of us niggers died, Marster was good to us an' let all de niggers quit
an' attend de burial. Dey made de coffins at home an' would black dem
wid soot.
""Us had a ol' quack herb doctor on de place. Some bad boys went up to
his house one night an' poured a whole lot of de medicine down him. An
honey, dat ol' man died de next day.
""Atter I got grown I married Robert Benson an' us had four chillun and
several grandchillun.""
Cornelia, beaming and apparently happy every minute of the day, lives
with one of her grandchildren in Opelika.","Interview with Cornelia Robinson

Interview with Cornelia Robinson

""One time I 'members a storm us had. I calls it a harricane; but it was
really de Yankees comin' through.""
Quaint, little Cornelia Robinson was anxious to give all the facts she
could remember about slavery days; but she was only about four years old
during the latter days of that period, and must depend a great deal on
what has been told her.
""Chile, dem Yankees come through an' cleaned out de smokehouse; even
lef' de lard bucket as clean as yo' hand. Ol' Marster tuk his bes'
horses an' mules to de big swamp, an' de Yankees couldn't fin' 'em. But
dey tore up everything dey couldn't take wid dem. Dey poured all de
syrup out an' it run down de road lak water.
""One pore little nigger boy was so skeered dat when he went out to git
up de cows an' when he couldn't fin' some of 'em, he laid down in a
hollow stump an' nearly froze to death. Dey had to thaw him out in de
branch, but he was powerful sick. He war'nt no 'count for nothin' atter
dat.
""I 'members dat Ol' Mistus saved all her jewels an' sech frum de
Yankees. She brung 'em out to de nigger cabins an' hid 'em amongst us.""
Cornelia, forever smiling, wears her gray hair in two short braids down
the back. She says her father and mother were George and Harriett
Yancey, who belonged first to a Mrs. Baugh and who were later sold to a
Dr. Trammell, of near Lafayette. Her brothers and sisters were Charlie,
Willie, Albert and Ann.

""I 'members de high, four-poster beds us useter sometimes sleep on,"" she
said. ""I was so little dat I had to crawl into 'em wid de help of a
stool. I 'members dat de mud fireplaces of early times was far back,
deep an' wide. All de little niggers was fed milk an' bread, wid de
bread crumbled in. Us also had pot licker an' greens.
""Our clothes was muslin an' calico for de hot weather; an' den in winter
us had linty cloth, part wool an' part cotton, homespun. Us raised de
sheep, too, but us didn't wear no clothes hardly in hot weather.
""Us sho' did have a good marster an' mistis. Dey give us all de clothes
an' food us needed an' gived us medicine. Us wore asafetida an' pennies
aroun' our necks to help us not to git sick.
""Dey taught my mother to read an' write, too. Not many done dat. She'd
read de Bible to us little niggers an' give prayers. Atter slavery, us
had schools. I 'members dat George Hawkins an' his wife taught it.""
Cornelia recalls some of the happenings of slavery times.
""If de slaves went off de plantation widout a pass, de patterollers
would ketch 'em an' beat 'em powerful bad. If de niggers could outrun de
patterollers an' git home fust dey couldn't be whupped. Dey had dogs
called 'nigger hounds', same like dey had bird dogs, an' dey would track
de slaves an' bring dem back home.
""I 'members my mother goin' to corn shuckin's. 'Course dey put us little
niggers to bed 'fore dey went but dey sho' sounded lak dey was havin' a
big time, hollerin' an' singin'. Us went to de white folks church in de
afternoon, an' de Reverend Gardner was a mighty good preacher. When any
of us niggers died, Marster was good to us an' let all de niggers quit
an' attend de burial. Dey made de coffins at home an' would black dem
wid soot.
""Us had a ol' quack herb doctor on de place. Some bad boys went up to
his house one night an' poured a whole lot of de medicine down him. An
honey, dat ol' man died de next day.
""Atter I got grown I married Robert Benson an' us had four chillun and
several grandchillun.""
Cornelia, beaming and apparently happy every minute of the day, lives
with one of her grandchildren in Opelika.","Interview with Cornelia Robinson

Interview with Allen Sims

Preston Klein, Opelika
While interviewing former slaves in the rural sections of Lee County, I
ran across Allen Sims, a sturdy old Negro, who proved to have an
unusually clear recollection of slavery as the institution appeared to
the small boy of that era. He was not old enough to make a work-hand at
its close. He spoke slowly, but with evident positiveness as to the
facts:
""I 'members lots 'bout slavery times; 'cause I was right dar. I don't
'member much 'bout de war, 'cause I was too little to know what war was,
and de most I seed was when de Yankees come through and burnt up de Big
House, de barns, de ginhouse and took all Old Marster's hosses and
mules, and kilt de milk-cows for beef. They didn't leave us nothing to
eat, and us lak to starve to death.
""Our folks, de Simses, dey come fum Virginny. My pappy and mammy was
borned dere. Dey names was Allen Sims and Kitty Sims. My Old Marster was
Marse Jimmie Sims, and my Old Mistis was Miss Creasie. Some of Pappy and
Mammy's chillun was borned in Virginny, and some of 'em in Alabama. I
was de baby chile, and I was borned right on dis very place whar us is
now. Dey had a whole passel of chillun. Dere was Chaney, Becky, Judy,
Sam, Phoebe, King, Alex, Jordan and Allen-dat's me.
""Us lived in a log house in de quarter, wid a board roof and a ol' rock
fireplace wid a stick and dirt chimley. We had plenty wood, and could
build jes' as big fire as we need, if de weather was cold. Mammy, she
cook ash-cake in de fireplace, and it was de bes' bread I ever eat,
better'n any dis store-bought bread. You ain't never eat no ash-cake?
Umph, Missy, you don't know what good bread is lak!
""Old Marster was good to his niggers and all of 'em, big and little had
plenty to eat, and it wa'n't trash neither. Us had ash-cake, hoe-cake,
pone-bread, meat and gravy, peas, greens, roast-neers, pot-liquor, and
sweet 'taters, I'ish taters, and goobers-I spec Old Marster's niggers
live better dan lots of white folks lives now.
""Aunt Mandy, what was too old to work, looked atter all de little nigger
chilluns, whilst dey mammys was working, and she whip us wid a brush, if
we didn't mind her; but she fuss more dan she whip, and it didn't hurt
much, but us cry lak she killing us.
""When us got sick, Old Mistis looked atter us herself, and she gin us
oil and turpentine and lobelia and if dat didn't cure us, she sont for
de doctor-de same doctor dat come to see her own fambly. Sometime a old
nigger die, and Old Marster and Old Mistis dey cry jes' lak us did. Dey
put 'em in a coffin and bury 'em in de graveyard, wid de white preacher
dar and nobody didn't work none dat day, atter us come back fum de
graveyard.
""Our beds was bunks in de corner of de room, nailed to de wall and jes'
one post out in de flo'. De little chilluns slep' crosswise de big bed
and it was plum' full in cold weather.
Allen Sims, Lee County, Alabama
""Our clothes was osnaburg, spun and weave' right at home, and it sho'
did last a long time. De little niggers jes' wore a long shirt, 'twell
dey got big 'nough to work in de field, and us had red shoes made at de
tan-yard to wear in winter time; but us foots was tough and us went
barefooted most all de winter too. Us played games too, ginerly, jumping
de rope and base.
""De grown niggers had good times Sadday nights, wid dances, suppers and
wras'lin. De corn-shuckings was de biggest time dey had, 'cause de
neighbors come and dey laughed and hollered nearly all night.
""Old Marster and Old Mistis lived in a big two-story white house. Dey
had ten chillun, five boys and five gals, and dey all growed up and
married off. De old carriage-driver was name Clark, and he sho' was
proud. De overseer was Tetter Roberson, and he was mean. He beat niggers
a lot, and bimeby Old Marster turned him off. He used to blow de horn
way befo' day to git de niggers up, and he work 'em 'tell smack dark.
""Atter de Yankees burned up everyt'ing 'cept de cabins, us jes' stayed
right dar wid Old Marster when us freed. Old Marster built a new house
for him and Old Mistis, but it wa'n't much better dan our cabin and dey
lived dere 'tell dey died.
""When I growed up, I married Laura Frazier, and us had a big wedding and
a preacher, and didn't jump over no broom lack some niggers did. Us had
jes' two chillun dat lived to be grown. Dey is Filmore and Mary Lou, and
us ain't got no gran'chillun.
""When I got grown, I j'ined de Baptist Church at Rough Neck, 'cause I
felt I had done enough wrong, and I been a deacon forty year.""","Interview with Allen Sims

Interview with George Strickland

Preston Klein, Opelika, Alabama
George Strickland, alert for all his ninety-one years but blinking in
the bright sunlight as he laid his battered felt hat beside the rocking
chair in front of his cabin in Opelika, Alabama, as he looked back down
the decades and remembered the times when ""cornshuckin' was de greates'
thing."" Though only a boy when the War between the States ended, he
recalled days of slavery easily as he told the following story.
""I was nine years old when us niggers was sot free an' 'fo' dat time us
refugeed from Mississippi to Mobile, den to Selma, den to Montgomery an'
from dar to Uchie, near Columbus, Georgia, whar we stayed 'til us was
freed.
""My mammy an' daddy come from Mississippi fust. Dey was Cleveland an'
Eve Strickland an' dar was fo' of us chilluns, Will, Sam, Missouri an'
me. Us quarters had dirt flo's an' was in two long rows wid a street
between. On de east side of de settlement was de barns, shops an' sich
like. De beds was boxed up an' nailed to de wall, den dey was filled wid
pinestraw. Dey fed us li'l niggers in wood troughs made of poplar. De
cook in de big house cooked pots of greens an' po'd potlikker an' all in
de troughs. Us et hit wid mussel shells or wid usses han's or gourds.
Our wimmin folks would bile de gourds to keep dem from being bitter.
Usses had two acre paster dat usses would turn under in de fall an'
plant hit in turnips. I 'clare fo' goodness dey growed nearly as big as
a gallon bucket.
""Dey gived us clo'es ev'y Saddy night an' de winter clo'es had some cow
hair in dem to make 'em warm.
""Ol' Marsa John Strickland was circuit preacher an' him an' Miss Polly
lived up in a big log house. De logs was hewed an' split an' lined on
each side. De logs stood on dey sides an' didn' lay flat. Dey chilluns
was Mary, Laura, Sallie, Wiley, George an' Lougene.
""When Ol' marsa went off to preach, de overseer was mean an' whupped de
niggers so bad Mistis runned him off. Dey had 'bout a hundred slaves an'
would wake dem up by beating on a big piece of sheet ine (iron) wid a
long piece of steel.
""De well didn' hab no windless but had a lever wid a bucket fastened on
one end of hit, an' we would hold to de yuther end to dip de bucket in
de water.
""When dey whupped de niggers dey would tie dem to a tree an' whup dem
good. When dey was sold dey would put 'em on a stand or block, as dey
called hit den, an' dey w'ud roll up dey sleeves to see de muscles. Den
dey bid on dem an' bought 'em for 'bout $1,000 to $1,500 apiece. Us
traveled in ox carts, an' I fust rid on a stage when I went to Uchie.
When slaves would be ver' bad dey would chain dem out all night. You
sho' had to stay at home an' wuk.
""Our chu'ch was nearby an' us sot nex' to de do'. Mistis called up all
de li'l niggers, talked to dem an' had pra'r. De yuthers had pra'r
meetin' oncet a week.
""De wimmin folks had a big time quiltin's wid somebody aplayin' on ol'
gourds wid horse hair strings, called old gourd, horse hair dance.
""Cornshuckin' was de greates' thing of all. Ol' Marsa tuck a jug of
likker 'roun' an' got dem tight an' when dey got full dey would h'ist
him up an' down, tote him 'roun' an' holler. Den de fun started an' dey
would play de old gourd an' horse hair dance, de han'saw an' case knife.
Dey could run dey han' up an' down de saw to change de tune an' de
leader was on top of de pile of corn singin' whilst all de yuthers
would follow.
""Us chilluns was 'sleep den, but us had our good times hidin' de switch
an' playin' han'-over ball. Dey sho' skeer us nearly into fits wid tales
of Rawhead and Bloody-bones.
""I'se never tuk a oath ner teched nothin' didn' b'long to me in all my
life.
""Our med'cin' was Jerus'lem oak seed what was beat up to give de
chilluns for worms.
""On Sund' mornin' dey giv' us biskits for breakfast, which was so rar'
dat we would try to beat de yuthers outten dey'n.
""Oncet dey piled ev'ythin' on waggins an' put all us li'l niggers on
top. Us rations, lak coffee, meal, meat an' mos' ev'ythin' was kivvered
over wid sheets. Den dey tuk us off an' us stayed t'ree days an' nights.
""Ol' marsa tuk one of de fellers wid him to be on de front line to help
keep off de Injuns, so us chilluns b'lieves.
George Strickland, Opelika, Alabama
""Dat battle of Atlanta was de wust thing dat's ever been. All de houses
for a fur piece jes' shuck from de big guns. De Yankees camped in a big
hundred acre fiel' close by. Den dey rushed up to de house, kicked de
gate down, tuk Mistiss trunk out an' bus' hit open huntin' money. But
dey foun' none, so dey sot fire to de house an' ast, whar de horses? De
niggers couldn' tell an' den dey burnt de house down.
""Atter dat, Ol' Marsa tell us, us is free from him but needn't leave
iffen us didn' want to go, but could stay on wid him an' he'd treat us
right an' give us half of what us made.
""In after years I ma'ed Josephine Bedell an' us had George, Phillip,
Renza, Eldridge (de baby), May Willie an' Leila. I's got some
gran-chillun, too, but kain't think of dey names.
""Hit was de plans of God to free us niggers an' not Abraham Lincoln's.
""I's allus tried to live under de correction of de Lord. Hit's my duty
to try to do so.""","Interview with George Strickland

Interview with Anthony Abercrombie

Susie R. O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama
Uncle Ant'ny sat dozing in the early morning sunshine on his rickety
front porch. He is a thin little old man with patches of white wool here
and there on his bald head, and an expression of kindness and gentleness
on his wrinkled old face.
As I went cautiously up the steps, which appeared none too safe, his
cane which had been leaning against his chair, fell to the floor with a
clatter. He awoke with a start and began fumbling around for it with his
trembling and bony hands.
""Uncle Ant'ny, you don't see so well, do you?"" I asked as I recovered
the stick for him. ""No ma'am, I sho' don't,"" he replied. ""I ain't seed
none outen one of my eyes in near 'bout sixty years, and de doctor say I
got a catalac on de yuther one; but I knows you is white folks. I always
is been puny, but I reckon I does purty well considerin' I is a hundred
years old.""
""How do you know you are that old?"" I inquired of him. Without
hesitation he answered, ""I knows I's dat old 'cause my mistis put it
down in de Bible. I was born on de fourth day and I was a full growed
man when de war come on in '61.
""Yassum, my mind kinder comes and goes, but I can always 'member 'bout
slave'y time. Hits de things what happen in dese days dat's so easy for
me to disremember. I b'longed to Marster Jim Abercrombie. His plantation
was 'bout sixteen miles north of Marion in Bibb county. When his son,
young Jim, ma'ied, old Marse Jim give me to him and he fetched me to
Perry county.
""No'm, old marster didn't go to war 'ca'se he was corrupted; he was
deaf in bofe ears and couldn't see good nuther. But he didn't care much
'bout me 'caze I was puny like and warn't much 'count in de field.
""My mistis, Miss Lou, was raisin' me up to be a carriage driver, an' she
was jes' as good to me as she could be. She useta dose me up wid castor
oil, jimson root, and dogwood tea when I'd be feelin' po'ly, and she'd
always take up for me when Marse Jim get in behind me 'bout somep'n. I
reckon though I was a purty worrisome nigger in dem days; always gettin'
in some kind of mischief.
""O yassum, I useta go to meetin'. Us niggers didn't have no meetin'
house on de plantation, but Marse Jim 'lowed us to build a brush arbor.
Den two years atter de surrender I took consideration and j'ined up wid
de Lawd. Dat's how come I live so long. De Lawd done told me, 'Antn'y,
you got a hundred and twenty miles to trabel. Dat mean you gwine to live
a hundred and twenty years, if you stay on de straight an' narrow road.
But if you don't, you gotter go jes' de same as all de yuthers.'""
""Tell me something about your master's slaves and his overseers,"" I
asked of him.
""Well,"" he said, ""Marse Jim had 'bout three hundred slaves, and he hed
one mighty bad overseer. But he got killed down on de bank of de creek
one night. Dey never did find out who killed him, but Marse Jim always
b'lieved de field han's done it. 'Fore dat us niggers useta go down to
de creek to wash ourselves, but atter de overseer got killed down
dar, us jes' leave off dat washin', 'cause some of 'em seed de
overseer's ha'nt down dar floatin' over de creek.
""Dar was another ha'nt on de plantation, too. Marse Jim had some trouble
wid a big double-j'inted nigger named Joe. One day he turn on Marse Jim
wid a fence rail, and Marse Jim had to pull his gun an' kill him. Well,
dat happen in a skirt of woods what I get my lightwood what I use to
start a fire. One day I went to dem same woods to get some 'simmons.
Another nigger went wid me, and he clumb de tree to shake de 'simmons
down whilst I be pickin' 'em up. 'Fore long I heared another tree
shakin' every time us shake our tree, dat other tree shake too, and down
came de 'simmons from it. I say to myself, 'Dat's Joe, 'cause he likes
'simmons too.' Den I grab up my basket and holler to de boy in de tree,
'nigger turn loose and drap down from dar, and ketch up wid me if you
can. I's leavin' here right now, 'cause Old Joe is over dar gettin'
'simmons too.'
""Den another time I was in de woods choppin' lightwood. It was 'bout
sundown, and every time my ax go 'whack' on de lightwood knot, I hear
another whack 'sides mine. I stops and lis'ens and don't hear nothin'.
Den I starts choppin' ag'in I hears de yuther whacks. By dat time my
houn' dog was crouchin' at my feets, wid de hair standin' up on his back
and I couldn't make him git up nor budge.
""Dis time I didn' stop for nothin'. I jes' drap my ax right dar, an' me
and dat houn' dog tore out for home lickety split. When us got dar Marse
Jim was settin' on de porch, an' he say: 'Nigger, you been up to somep'n
you got no business. You is all outen breath. Who you runnin' from?' Den
I say: 'Marse Jim, somebody 'sides me is choppin' in yo' woods, an' I
can't see him. And Marse Jim, he say: 'Ah, dat ain't nobody but Ole Joe.
Did he owe you anythin'?' An' I say: 'Yassah, he owe me two-bits for
helpin' him shuck corn.' 'Well,' Marse Jim say, 'don't pay him no mind:
it jes' Old Joe come back to pay you.'
""Anyhow, I didn' go back to dem woods no mo'. Old Joe can jes' have de
two-bits what he owe me, 'cause I don't want him follerin' 'roun' atter
me. When he do I can't keep my mind on my business.""","Interview with Anthony Abercrombie

Interview with Tildy Collins

Susie R. O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama
Like nearly all old Negroes, Aunt Tildy goes to sleep very readily. She
was dozing in a rocker on her small porch, while the scent of wood smoke
and the odor of boiling vegetables issued from the cabin. An iron pot,
hanging from a crane in the fireplace, sending forth clouds of steam and
an appetizing aroma. She clings to old fashioned equipment and disdains
a stove for cooking. Her ""biled"" vegetables or meats in the hanging pot,
with baked potatoes and ""pone"" bread from the oven make up a meal that
leaves little to be desired, as many visitors who have shared her
repasts well know.
As the gate squeaked, Aunt Tildy awoke with a start and a smile.
""Come in, white folks, I was jes' a-settin' here waitin' for my greens
to bile, an' I musta drapped off to sleep. Set down in dat cheer right
dar, an' tek off your hat; you sho' is lookin' well, an' I'se proud to
see you.
""Yas, ma'am, I sho' was borned in slavery times, an' I wish to Gawd I
could git now what I useter hab den, 'caze dem was good times for de
black folks. Dese free niggers don't know what 'tis to be tuk good keer
of.
""Co'se I means dat! I was borned on a big plantation near 'bout to
Linden, an' my Ole Marster was name Harris, yassum, Dick Harris, an' my
Ole Mistis was Miss Mandy. Bofe dey boys fit in de wah, an' I 'members
when dey went off wid de sojers, ole Mistis she cry an' hug dem boys an'
kiss 'em goodbye, an' dey was gone a long time. I was a leetle gal
whenst dey went to de wah, an' I was mos' a grown 'oman when dey come
home, an' dey bofe had whiskers. Young Massa Richard he limpin' an' look
mighty pale, an' dey say he been wounded an' stay in prison on Mister
Johnson's island, summuz up de ribber; but Marse Willis, he look all
right, 'cep'in' whiskers. Ole Marster had a big house, an' dat same
house standin' dar right now. Us had plenty to eat an' plenty to wear,
an' dat's mo'n what some folks got now.
""Ole Marster was good to all he niggers, an' my pappy and mammy bofe
belonged to him. Dey was a slave-yard in Uniontown, an' ev'y time a
spec'later cum wid a lot of new niggers, Ole Marster he buy four or five
niggers, an' dat's how he come to buy my pappy, atter de spec'later
brung him an' a whole passel of niggers from North C'lina. My mammy here
already 'long to Ole Marster. Her was borned his'n.
""Sometime a no 'count nigger tek an' runned erway; but de oberseer, he
put de houn's on he track, an' dey run him up a tree, an' de oberseer
fetch him back nex' mawnin', all tuckerd out, an' he' glad to stay home
for a spell an' 'have hese'f. Ole Marster had a good oberseer, too.
'Cose he wan't no quality, lak Ole Marster an' Ole Mistis, but he was a
good, kin' man an' he didn't hab no trouble on de whole plantation.
""Us alluz had a Chris'mus tree in de quarter, jes' lak de white folks
an' dey was presents for ev'ybody-nobody wan't lef' out, big or little.
Dere was a meetin' house on de plantation an' Ole Marster had a rule dat
all de chilluns had to go to Sunday school soon as dey was big 'nuff,
an' dey had to go in clean white clo'se, too. Us chilluns hate to see
Sunday come, 'caze Mammy an' Granmammy dey wash us an' near 'bout rub de
skin off gittin' us clean for Sunday school, an' dey comb our heads wid
a jimcrow. You ain't neber seed a jimcrow? Hit mos' lak a card what you
card wool wid. What a card look lak? Humph! Missy, whar you been
raise-ain't neber seed a card? Dat jimcrow sho' did hurt, but us
hadder stan' hit, an' sometimes atter all dat, Mammy she wrap our kinky
hair wid t'read an' twis' so tight us's eyes couldn't hardly shet.
""My Granmammy, her de head cook 'oman at de big house, an' us had to
mine her lak us did Mammy. I ho'p Granmammy in de kitchen, atter I got
big 'nuff an' she sho' did keep me humpin'. Chilluns had to mine dey
olders in dem days. Dey wan't lak dey is now, don't mine nobody, not
eben dey Pa.
""When de surrender come, Ole Marster he tole all de niggers dey was free
now, an' some was glad an' some was sorry an' welst dey might be sorry,
iffen dey knowed what a hard time dey goner had knockin' 'roun' de worl'
by deyself; no Ole Marster an' no Ole Mistis ter look atter 'em an' feed
'em when dey sick an' when dey well. Look lak ter me, when de surrender
parted de white folks an' de black folks, it hurt 'em bofe. Dey oughter
be tergedder, jes' lak de Good Lord 'tended dey be.""
Aunt Tildy sighed deeply and, gazing afar off, said: ""Iffen Ole Marster
was livin' now, I'd be all right an' not hafter worry 'bout nuffin.""
In spite of her eighty-four years, Aunt Tildy makes her living as a
mid-wife and serves as a ""doctor man"" in cases of minor ailments; but
her practice is so closely interwoven with ""conju'in'"" that it is
difficult to say which is the more important to her. For example: she
prescribes wearing matches in the hair or a little salt on the mole of
the head for headache. Her sovereign remedy for rheumatism is ""'nint de
j'ints wid a little kerosene oil an' put some mullen leaves on it."" ""A
good dost of turpentine is good for mos' anything de matter wid you."" A
coin with a hole in it, usually a dime, tied around the ankle will keep
you from getting ""pizen."" Furthermore, this same treatment warns against
the ill effects of getting ""conju'ed."" ""Iffen you gits conju'ed, de dime
turn black, an' you kin go to de conju' doctor an' git de conju' took
off.""
""Is you got to go, Missy? Come back agin. I's allus proud to see you,""
Aunt Tildy called after me from the edge of the porch.","Interview with Tildy Collins

Interview with Katherine Eppes
-
Susie R. O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama
""Ma"" Eppes sat on the steps of her weatherbeaten, unpainted little
cabin, duplicate of the dozens that make up Rat Row, Negro quarter of
Uniontown, and looked down the vista of memory to her childhood when she
lived in ""where de log cabins stretched as far as you could see in de
slave qua'ters.""
Despite her eighty-seven years, Katherine Eppes, known to everyone as
""Ma,"" came as spryly to her tiny porch as her rotund body would permit.
She smiled broadly at her interviewer and seated herself slowly.
""Sho', honey, I can tell you mo'n anything you want to know 'bout the
big fight, 'ca'se I been here a long time,"" she began her story. ""Dey
ain't many lef' to tell 'bout dem days. My mammy an' pappy was Peter an'
Emma Lines an' us all belonged to Marsa Frank and Miss Sarah Lines. I
was born on dey plantation five miles below Faunsdale 'bout 1850 so dey
tells me.
""I is right ol' but thank Gawd I still got my teefies an' my ha'r lef'.""
Proudly the old woman unwrapped her ""head rag"" to display a thick mop,
woolly white but neatly parted into squares. Dozens of little plaits,
wrapped with yards of twine, just as her hair had been dressed in the
slave quarters before the War, adorned her head. She sat with uncovered
head unblinking in the bright June sunshine, as she took up the tale of
her health. ""I sees pretty good, too, but I's so hebby I ain't able to
toe myse'f 'roun' as pert as I useter.
""It was diff'rent back in dem days when I belonged to rich white folks.
Dey had plenty of niggers an' dey was log cabins in de quarters jes' as
far as your eyes could see. Marsa Frank an' Miss Sarah was good to de
black folks, too. Dey son, young marsa Frank, fit in de big war. Atter
de war was over I stayed on de Lines' place 'twell atter I ma'ied, an'
Ol' Miss gin me my weddin' dress an' a long veil down to my foots.
""When us was chillun in de quarters we did a mighty lot of playin'. Us
useta play 'Sail away Rauley' a whole lot. Us would hol' han's an' go
'roun' in a ring, gittin' faster an' faster an' dem what fell down was
outa de game.
""My mammy wukked in de Big House, aspinnin' an' anussin' de white
chillun. All of dem called her 'mammy.' Ah 'members one thing jes' lack
it was yestiddy. Miss Sarah went to 'Mospolis (Demopolis) to visit wid
her sister, an' whilst she were gone de oberseer, what go by de name of
Allen, whupped my Mammy crost her back 'twell de blood runned out.
""When Miss Sarah comed back an' foun' it out, she was de maddes white
lady I eber seed. She sont for de oberseer, an' she say: 'Allen, what
you mean by whupping Mammy? You know I don't allow you to tech my house
servants.' She jerk her dress down an' stan' dere lookin' like a sojer
wid her white shoulders shinin' lack a snow bank, an' she say: 'I
'druther see dem marks on my own shoulders dan to see 'em on Mammy's.
Dey wouldn't hurt me no wuss.' Den she say: 'Allen, teck your fambly an'
git offen my place. Don't you let sundown ketch you here. 'So he lef'.
He wasn't nothin' but white trash nohow.""
""Ma"" Eppes sat silent for a time as she recalled the vision of Miss
Sarah standing straight and regal in her dismissal of the overseer.
Finally she turned with an abrupt change of subject.
""Honey, is you a Christian?"" she asked earnestly. ""I hopes you is, ca'se
you is too fine lookin' for to go to Hell. I b'longs to de Baptis'
Church, an' dey calls me Ma Eppes 'ca'se I's de mother of de church. I
loves to sing de gospel Hymns.""
She began to sing in a high, cracked voice, her body swaying with the
rhythm. The song rose until her neighbors had gathered to form quite an
audience. With much moaning between every line, she sang:
""I am a sojer of de Cross,
A follerer of de Lam'.
I'm not afeard to own His name,
Nor to 'fen' His cause.""
(Chorus)
""I wan' you to come,
I wan' you to come,
I wan' you to come
An' be saved.""
She was still singing as I left her, the neighbors joining in the
choruses. Suppers would be late in the row of weatherbeaten cabins,
because the spirit of song was on the gathering.","Interview with Katherine Eppes

Susie R. O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama
""White folks,"" said Heywood Ford, ""I'se gonna tell you a story 'bout a
mean oberseer an' whut happened to him durin' de slabery days. It all
commenced when a nigger named Jake Williams got a whuppin' for stayin'
out atter de time on his pass done gib out. All de niggers on de place
hated de oberseer wuss dan pizen, 'caze he was so mean an' useta try to
think up things to whup us for.
""One mornin' de slaves was lined up ready to eat dere breakfas' an' Jake
Williams was a pettin' his ole red-bone houn'. 'Bout dat time de
oberseer come up an' seed Jake a pettin' his houn' an' he say: 'Nigger
you ain't got time to be a-foolin' 'long dat dog. Now make him git.'
Jake tried to make de dog go home, but de dog didn't want to leave Jake.
Den de oberseer pick up a rock an' slam de dog in de back. De dog he den
went a-howlin' off.
""Dat night Jake he come to my cabin an' he say to me: 'Heywood, I is
gonna run away to a free State. I ain't a-gonna put up wid dis treatment
no longer. I can't stand much mo'. I gibs him my han' an' I say: 'Jake,
I hopes you gits dere. Maybe I'll see you ag'in sometime.'
""'Heywood,' he says, 'I wish you'd look atter my houn', Belle. Feed her
an' keep her de bes' you kin. She a mighty good possum an' coon dog. I
hates to part wid her, but I knows dat you is de bes' pusson I could
leave her wid.' An' wid dat Jake slip out de do' an' I seed him
a-walkin' toward de swamp down de long furrows of cawn.
""It didn't take dat oberseer long to fin' out dat Jake done run away,
an', when he did, he got out de blood houn's an' started off atter him.
It warn't long afore Jake heered dem houn's a-howlin' in de distance.
Jake he was too tired to go any further. He circled 'roun' an' doubled
on his tracks so as to confuse de houn's an' den he clumb a tree.
T'warn't long afore he seed de light of de oberseer comin' th'ough de
woods and de dogs was a-gittin' closer an' closer. Finally dey smelled
de tree dat Jake was in an' dey started barkin' 'roun' it. De oberseer
lif' his lighted pine knot in de air so's he could see Jake. He say:
'Nigger, come on down fum dere. You done wasted 'nuff of our time.' But
Jake, he neber move nor make a sound an' all de time de dogs keppa
howlin' an' de oberseer keppa swearin'. 'Come on down,' he say ag'in;
'iffen you don't I'se comin' up an' knock you outen de tree wid a
stick.' Jake still he neber moved an' de oberseer den began to climb de
tree. When he got where he could almos' reach Jake he swung dat stick
an' it come down on Jake's leg an' hurt him tur'ble. Jake, he raised his
foot an' kicked de oberseer raght in de mouf, an' dat white man went a
tumblin' to de groun'. When he hit de earth dem houn's pounced on him.
Jake he den lowered hisself to de bottom limbs so's he could see what
had happened. He saw de dogs a-tearin' at de man an' he holla: 'Hol'
'im, Belle! Hol' 'im, gal!' De leader of dat pack of houn's, white
folks, warn't no blood houn'. She was a plain old red-bone possum an'
coon dog, an' de res' done jus' lak she done, tearin' at de oberseer's
th'oat. All de while, Jake he a-hollerin' f'um de tree fer dem dogs to
git 'im. 'Twarn't long afore dem dogs to' dat man all to pieces. He died
raght under dat maple tree dat he run Jake up. Jake he an' dat coon
houn' struck off through de woods. De res' of de pack come home.
""I seed Jake atter us niggers was freed. Dat's how come I knowed all
'bout it. It musta been six years atter dey killed de oberseer. It was
in Kentucky dat I run across Jake. He was a-sittin' on some steps of a
nigger cabin. A houn' dog was a-sittin' at his side. I tells him how
glad I is to see him, an' den I look at de dog. 'Dat ain't Belle,' I
says. 'Naw,' Jake answers, 'Dis her puppy.' Den he tol' me de whole
story. I always did want to know what happen to 'em.""","Interview with Heywood Ford

Interview with Irene Poole

Susie R. O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama
Under the spreading branches of an enormous fig tree laden with ripe
fruit ""Aunt Irene"" sat dreaming of old times. At her feet several
chickens scratched and waited for the soft plop of an over ripe fig as
it fell to the ground.
Aunt Irene's back is bent with age and rheumatism, but her two-room
cabin is as clean and neat as a pin. Her small yard is a mass of color
where marigolds, zinnias, verbena and cockscomb run riot, and over the
roughly-made arch at the gate trailed cypress vine in full bloom. ""Good
morning Aunt Irene,"" I said. ""A penny for your thoughts.""
""Well honey, I don't know as dey is wo'th a penny; not to you anyhow. I
was jes' stud'in' 'bout ole times an' 'bout mah ole marster. You know if
he was livin' today he would be a hundred an' sixteen years ole.""
""Who was your master Aunt Irene? Tell me about him.""
""His name was Jeff Anderson Poole an' he was de bes' man in de world.
Mah ole miss was name Mollie. I was born on his plantation three miles
from Uniontown eighty five years ago.
""Mah pappy, Alfred Poole, b'longed to Marse Jeff an' he bought mah
mammy, Palestine Kent, from another plantation 'cause mah pappy jes'
couldn' do no work fer thinkin' 'bout her.
""Marse Jeff paid fifteen hunderd dollars for my mammy an' her three
little chillun. Marse Jeff was rich, he owned three big plantations an'
Lawd knows how many niggers. Dey was a hunderd head on our plantation.
He lacked to race horses an' had a stable full o' fine racers. I spec'
he made lots o' his money on dem horses. Miss Mollie say when he win he
swell out his ches' an' stick his thum's in de armhole of his ves' an'
talk 'bout it, but when he lose he don't say nothin'.
""Yas ma'am dere was always plenty to eat. A thousan' poun's o' meat
wasn't nothin' to kill on our plantation. My mammy was de cook in de big
house an' my pappy driv de carriage an' went 'roun' wid Marse Jeff when
he tuck trips. I was a house servant too. When I wasn' nothin' mo' in a
baby, de oberseer's wife tuck me to train, so I would know how to ac' in
de big house.
""One day she started to give me a whuppin'. Us was out in de yard an'
when she bent over to git a switch I runned under her hoopskirt. When
she look 'roun' she didn't see me nowhar. After while she started on up
to de house an' I runned along wid her under de hoopskirt, takin' little
steps so I wouldn't trip her up, till I seed a chance to slip out.""
Irene threw back her head and laughed loud and long at this amusing
memory.
Asked then about her mistress she said: ""Yas ma'am she was good. She
never punished me, she used to go 'roun' de quarters eve'y mornin' to
see 'bout her sick niggers. She always had a little basket wid oil,
teppentine an' number six in it. Number six was strong medicine. You had
to take it by de drap. I always toted de basket. She gived me mah
weddin' dress. It was white tarletan wid ban's o' blue ribbin. I sole de
dress las' year but I can show you de pantalets she made me. I used to
wear 'em to meetin' on Sunday when us had singin' an' de preacher said
words."" Aunt Irene brought out the deep ruffled pantalets carefully
folded and yellow with age, she had treasured them for seventy-five
years.
""No ma'am, Marse Jeff didn't go to de war, I don't know why. I guess it
was 'cause he was so rich. Now don't you be thinkin' he was gun shy,
'cause he wasn't an' he done his part too 'cause he took keer o' five
widders an' dey chillun when dey men got kilt in de war.
""My pappy lef de night de Yankees tuck Selma. It was on Sunday, an' I
ain't seed him since.
""After de surrender us staid on with Marse Jeff. Us didn't keer nothin'
'bout bein' free 'cause us had good times on de plantation. On Sadday
dey had corn shuckin's an' de niggers had a week at Chris'mas wid
presents for eve'ybody. Camping at de big house an' mo' to eat in one
day den I sees now in a year.
""Aunt Irene, do you remember anything about the conjurers in the old
days?""
""I don't put much sto' by dem folks. Dey used to give you de han' so you
could please yo' mistess an' dey would sell you hush water in a jug.
Hush water was jes' plain water what dey fixed so if you drink it you
would be quiet an' patient. De mens would git it to give to dey wives to
make 'em hush up. I reckon some of de mens would be glad to git some now
'cause gals dese days is got too much mouf.""","Interview with Irene Poole

Interview with John Smith
-
Susie R. O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama
John Smith is 103 but he doesn't want to be tied down. ""Effen I's free,
I wants to 'joy it,"" John says, and he lives up to his desire. Though he
is a ""war veter'n"" with bullets in his side and leg and his century of
life has enfeebled him, he roams the countryside about Uniontown
continually, ""settin' a spell"" with his acquaintances.
It was only after several trips I finally caught him ""settin',"" and he
showed no inclination to move from his advantageous position near a
watermelon patch. He was industriously working on a huge slice of melon,
his face buried in the sweet fruit, as I drove up to the little cabin
where he was visiting.
As the car came to a stop he raised his head and wiped his dripping chin
on his sleeve. He called to a little Negro girl in the yard, ""Gal, go
bring de white lady a rockin' cheer"", and turning to me he said, ""You'll
'scuse me for not gittin' up lak I ain't got no manners, won't you
Mistess? I got a misery in my laig; you know de one whar I got shot in
de war.""
The rocking chair was brought out and taking a seat nearby I said,
""Uncle John, I want you to tell me all about yourself, were you in the
war and are you really a hundred and three years old?""
""Glad to, glad to mistess, but fust don't you want a watermillon?"" He
pointed to a patch nearby where the melons glistened in the sun. ""Dis
July sun make de juice so sweet you'll smack yo' mouf for mo',"" and
searching the rind to see that he had left none of the juicy red meat,
Uncle John began his story.
""Well, I been livin' 'roun' dese parts 'bout ninety year. I
was born somewar in North Ca'lina, I don't 'member much 'bout my
Mammy an' Pappy 'cause I was took 'way from dem by de speckerlaters
when I was 'bout thirteen year ole. De speckerlaters raised Niggers
to sell. Dey would feed 'em up an' git 'em fat and slick and make
money on 'em. I was sold off de block in 'Speckerlater's Grove' in
North Ca'lina. De fus' day I was put up I didn't sold, but de nex'
day I brung a thousand dollars. Mr. Saddler Smith from Selma bought
me. Dey called him Saddler Smith cause he was in de saddle business
and made saddles for de army. Dey fotch us down on boats. I 'member
de song de men on de boat singed. Hit go like dis:
Up an' down de Mobile Ribber,
Two speckerlaters for one po' lil nigger.
""My marster was de best in dis country. He didn't had many niggers, but
he sho' tuck good keer o' dem what he did had. He didn't 'low nobody to
hit 'em a lick. Sometime when I would git cotch up wid in some diverment
de white folks would say, 'Whose nigger is you?"" and I say, 'Marse
Saddler Smith.' Den dey look at each oder an' say kinder low, 'Better
not do nothin' to ole Smith's nigger. He'll raise de debil.'
""I didn't had no mistiss. My marster was a widder. He raised me up
workin' 'roun' de saddle shop. I ain't never liked to work nowhow, but
don't tell nobody dat. I was bout twenty seven year ole when de war
broke out. De ole uns was called out fust and de young uns stayed home
and practiced so dey could shoot straight an' kill a Yankee. Us
practiced every Friday evenin'. Course I didn't know what dey fightin'
'bout. I jes' knowed dey was mad 'bout somepin'. Atter while Marster's
son Jim j'ined de 'Federate sogers an' I went wid him for to tote his
knapsack, canteen and sichlike and to look atter him. Dat's when I got
dese here balls in my side and got a bullet in my laig, too. I was
movin' de hawses to de back of de lines out de thick of de fight when,
zipp, a minit ball cotch me right in de shoulder.""
Proudly John displayed the balls in his side and the scar on his leg.
The old woman, at whose cabin John was visiting, interrupted the story
several times. Finally he got tired of it and said: ""Shet yo' mouf
'oman, I don't need no ho'p, dis is grown folks talk, you don't know
nothin' 'bout it, you wasn't even birthed tell two year 'fo' de
Surrender. Now whar was I at? I slep' right by Marsa Jim's side.
Sometime atter us done laid down and bofe of us be thinkin' 'bout home,
Marse Jim say, 'John, I lak to have some chicken.' I don't say nothin' I
jes' ease up an' pull my hat down over my eyes an' slip out. Atter while
I come back wid a bunch o'chickens crost my shoulder. Nex' mornin' Marse
Jim have nice brown chicken floatin' in graby what I done cook for him.
Us was fightin' on Blue Mountain when Marse Jim got kilt. I looked and
looked for him but I never did find him. Atter I lost my marster I
didn't 'long to nobody and de Yankee's was takin' eve'y thing anyhow, so
dey tuck me wid dem.
""I tuck keer of Gen'l Wilson's hawse, Gen'l Wilson was de head man in de
Yankee army. But I didn't lak dey ways much. He wanted his hawse kep'
spick and span. He would take his white pocket hankercher an' rub over
de hawse and if it was dirty he had me whupped. I was wid Gen'l Wilson
when he tuck Selma 'gins't Gen'l Forrest and sot fire to all dem things.
I drive de artillery wagon sometime. Atter Surrender I was kinda puny
wid de balls in my side.""
""John,"" I asked, ""why didn't they remove the balls at the time
you were shot?""
""How could dey 'move de balls when I was runnin' fast as I could pick up
my foots? I driv de stagecoach twixt Selma and Montgomery. I 'member my
stops. Dey was Selma, Benton, Lown'esboro and Mon'gomery. I driv four
hawses to it. Dere was a libbery stable at Benton and I changed hawses
dere.""
""Now John tell me about your wife and children,"" I said. ""How many
children did you have?""
""Gawd, I don't know mistess. Dey runnin' 'roun' de country like hawgs.
Dey don't know me an' I don't know dem. I ain't never been mai'ed.
Niggers didn't marry in dem days. I jes' tuk up wid one likely gal atter
anoder. I ain't even mai'ed to de one I got now. I jes' ain't gwine tie
myse'f down. Effen I's free, I's gwine to be free.""
Uncle John sat for a time in deep thought, then said, ""I wish I mought
be back in dem days, 'cause I been seed de debil since I been free.
Atter I was free I didn't had no marster to 'pend on and I was hongry a
heap of times. I 'long to de 'Federate nation and always will 'long to
y'all, but I reckon it's jes' as well we is free 'cause I don't b'lieve
de white folks now days would make good marsters.""
Uncle John had about talked out and as I rose to leave I said, ""Thank
you John, this will make a good story,"" to which he replied indignantly,
""Hit ain't no story. Hit's de Gawd's trufe mistess.""","Interview with John Smith

Interview with John Smith
-
Susie R. O'Brien, Uniontown, Alabama
John Smith is 103 but he doesn't want to be tied down. ""Effen I's free,
I wants to 'joy it,"" John says, and he lives up to his desire. Though he
is a ""war veter'n"" with bullets in his side and leg and his century of
life has enfeebled him, he roams the countryside about Uniontown
continually, ""settin' a spell"" with his acquaintances.
It was only after several trips I finally caught him ""settin',"" and he
showed no inclination to move from his advantageous position near a
watermelon patch. He was industriously working on a huge slice of melon,
his face buried in the sweet fruit, as I drove up to the little cabin
where he was visiting.
As the car came to a stop he raised his head and wiped his dripping chin
on his sleeve. He called to a little Negro girl in the yard, ""Gal, go
bring de white lady a rockin' cheer"", and turning to me he said, ""You'll
'scuse me for not gittin' up lak I ain't got no manners, won't you
Mistess? I got a misery in my laig; you know de one whar I got shot in
de war.""
The rocking chair was brought out and taking a seat nearby I said,
""Uncle John, I want you to tell me all about yourself, were you in the
war and are you really a hundred and three years old?""
""Glad to, glad to mistess, but fust don't you want a watermillon?"" He
pointed to a patch nearby where the melons glistened in the sun. ""Dis
July sun make de juice so sweet you'll smack yo' mouf for mo',"" and
searching the rind to see that he had left none of the juicy red meat,
Uncle John began his story.
""Well, I been livin' 'roun' dese parts 'bout ninety year. I
was born somewar in North Ca'lina, I don't 'member much 'bout my
Mammy an' Pappy 'cause I was took 'way from dem by de speckerlaters
when I was 'bout thirteen year ole. De speckerlaters raised Niggers
to sell. Dey would feed 'em up an' git 'em fat and slick and make
money on 'em. I was sold off de block in 'Speckerlater's Grove' in
North Ca'lina. De fus' day I was put up I didn't sold, but de nex'
day I brung a thousand dollars. Mr. Saddler Smith from Selma bought
me. Dey called him Saddler Smith cause he was in de saddle business
and made saddles for de army. Dey fotch us down on boats. I 'member
de song de men on de boat singed. Hit go like dis:
Up an' down de Mobile Ribber,
Two speckerlaters for one po' lil nigger.
""My marster was de best in dis country. He didn't had many niggers, but
he sho' tuck good keer o' dem what he did had. He didn't 'low nobody to
hit 'em a lick. Sometime when I would git cotch up wid in some diverment
de white folks would say, 'Whose nigger is you?"" and I say, 'Marse
Saddler Smith.' Den dey look at each oder an' say kinder low, 'Better
not do nothin' to ole Smith's nigger. He'll raise de debil.'
""I didn't had no mistiss. My marster was a widder. He raised me up
workin' 'roun' de saddle shop. I ain't never liked to work nowhow, but
don't tell nobody dat. I was bout twenty seven year ole when de war
broke out. De ole uns was called out fust and de young uns stayed home
and practiced so dey could shoot straight an' kill a Yankee. Us
practiced every Friday evenin'. Course I didn't know what dey fightin'
'bout. I jes' knowed dey was mad 'bout somepin'. Atter while Marster's
son Jim j'ined de 'Federate sogers an' I went wid him for to tote his
knapsack, canteen and sichlike and to look atter him. Dat's when I got
dese here balls in my side and got a bullet in my laig, too. I was
movin' de hawses to de back of de lines out de thick of de fight when,
zipp, a minit ball cotch me right in de shoulder.""
Proudly John displayed the balls in his side and the scar on his leg.
The old woman, at whose cabin John was visiting, interrupted the story
several times. Finally he got tired of it and said: ""Shet yo' mouf
'oman, I don't need no ho'p, dis is grown folks talk, you don't know
nothin' 'bout it, you wasn't even birthed tell two year 'fo' de
Surrender. Now whar was I at? I slep' right by Marsa Jim's side.
Sometime atter us done laid down and bofe of us be thinkin' 'bout home,
Marse Jim say, 'John, I lak to have some chicken.' I don't say nothin' I
jes' ease up an' pull my hat down over my eyes an' slip out. Atter while
I come back wid a bunch o'chickens crost my shoulder. Nex' mornin' Marse
Jim have nice brown chicken floatin' in graby what I done cook for him.
Us was fightin' on Blue Mountain when Marse Jim got kilt. I looked and
looked for him but I never did find him. Atter I lost my marster I
didn't 'long to nobody and de Yankee's was takin' eve'y thing anyhow, so
dey tuck me wid dem.
""I tuck keer of Gen'l Wilson's hawse, Gen'l Wilson was de head man in de
Yankee army. But I didn't lak dey ways much. He wanted his hawse kep'
spick and span. He would take his white pocket hankercher an' rub over
de hawse and if it was dirty he had me whupped. I was wid Gen'l Wilson
when he tuck Selma 'gins't Gen'l Forrest and sot fire to all dem things.
I drive de artillery wagon sometime. Atter Surrender I was kinda puny
wid de balls in my side.""
""John,"" I asked, ""why didn't they remove the balls at the time
you were shot?""
""How could dey 'move de balls when I was runnin' fast as I could pick up
my foots? I driv de stagecoach twixt Selma and Montgomery. I 'member my
stops. Dey was Selma, Benton, Lown'esboro and Mon'gomery. I driv four
hawses to it. Dere was a libbery stable at Benton and I changed hawses
dere.""
""Now John tell me about your wife and children,"" I said. ""How many
children did you have?""
""Gawd, I don't know mistess. Dey runnin' 'roun' de country like hawgs.
Dey don't know me an' I don't know dem. I ain't never been mai'ed.
Niggers didn't marry in dem days. I jes' tuk up wid one likely gal atter
anoder. I ain't even mai'ed to de one I got now. I jes' ain't gwine tie
myse'f down. Effen I's free, I's gwine to be free.""
Uncle John sat for a time in deep thought, then said, ""I wish I mought
be back in dem days, 'cause I been seed de debil since I been free.
Atter I was free I didn't had no marster to 'pend on and I was hongry a
heap of times. I 'long to de 'Federate nation and always will 'long to
y'all, but I reckon it's jes' as well we is free 'cause I don't b'lieve
de white folks now days would make good marsters.""
Uncle John had about talked out and as I rose to leave I said, ""Thank
you John, this will make a good story,"" to which he replied indignantly,
""Hit ain't no story. Hit's de Gawd's trufe mistess.""","Interview with John Smith

Eliza White lives by the Central of Georgia Railroad tracks in Opelika.
The passing of many years has not dulled her mind, and so she was able
to tell of many things which happened ""befo' de wah.""
""Yas, suh, I was a slave. Ole Massa was name' Billy Jones, and Ole
Mistis was name' Angeline. Dey lived in Harris County, Georgia, close to
Columbus. My pappy and mammy was Peter and Frances Jones, and I had a
brother, Dennis, and a sister, Georgianne.
""Massa was a good man, and I did love Ole Mistis. Dey was mighty good to
us niggers; fed us out dey own garden. We had checked homespun clothes
foh eve'yday, and purty calico and dyed osnaburg ones foh Sunday. I went
to church wid de white folks, settin' in de foot of de carriage. I
'members well de Sunday I fust seen a shoutin'. It was two white ladies.
""Massa and Mistis had four chillun. Two of dem, Dave and Quit, was bad
fighting kids. I seen Massa make dem strip to dey waist, and whip 'em,
den make dem go in and bathe.
""Massa lived in a big, fine white house. He had two or three hundred
slaves, and de quarters was in two long rows, runnin' up near 'bout to
de big house on de hill. Dey even raised deer on de place. De houses in
de quarters was two-room log houses wid a shed room to cook in. My mammy
was de cook at de big house, and granny was de weaver. Pappy was de
bedmaker; he made most of de beds outen poplar. I had a little chair in
de corner where I sot and kept de flies offen Mistis wid a green twig
brush.
""Whenever Massa sont any de slaves offen de place he had to gib 'em
passes so de patterollers wouldn't ketch 'em and whip 'em foh runnin'
away. De patterollers was a good thing foh de lazy ones. When daylight
come we had to get up, else we'd be whipped. Massa didn't have his
slaves whipped much; just when dey was lazy and wouldn't work.
""Ev'ey now and den we would have some good frolics, mostly on Sattiday
nights. Somebody would play de fiddle and we all danced to de music. De
folks sure had some big times at de cornshuckin's, too. De men would
work two or three days, haulin' de corn and pilin' it near de crib. Den
dey would invite folks from other quarters to come and help wid de
shuckin'. While dey shucked dey would holler and sing:
You jumped and I jumped;
Swear, by God you out jumped me.
Huh! Huh! Round de corn, Sally.
""Granny used to give us tea made outen sage roots, mullen, pine,
hoarhound-dat sho' was bitter stuff. We had purty beads made wid corn.
And I still 'members de Christmas I got my fust shoes. I just hugged dem
tight and went to sleep holdin' 'em. Dey was button shoes.
""When we heard de Yankees was comin' we hid all de meat and rations and
de silver in de big swamp, and turned de horses loose, and all us kids
hid in de bedticks (mattresses). De Yankees stayed around two or three
days and would pull de hands out of dere beds by dey toes.
""But I really seed a ha'nt one time. I knowed it was. De was one old man
been havin' de toothache all de time; he used to keep he jaw tied up. I
was gwine over to see him day time. Well, 'fore I got dere I seen what
look like him comin'. When I got nearer he turned to a man riding a mule
and wearing a big hat. Den, 'fore he got to de house he was plum gone.
Dat's how I knowed it was a ha'nt.""","Interview with Eliza White, age around 80

Interview with Esther King Casey
-
Edward F. Harper, Birmingham
Less vivid in her memory are the stories told her by her grandmother
of a long voyage across the ocean, of the arrival in a new land
called Mobile, and of slaves being sold at public auction. Less vivid,
too, are the memories of her own journey to Georgia, where she, with
her parents and brother, were brought to be the slaves of Captain King.
""I was only four or five years old when we came to Captain King's big
house,"" said the old woman, brightening with pride in her ability to
recollect. Her manners bore the marks of culture and refinement, and her
speech was surprisingly void of the usual Negro dialect. She is an
example of the former slave who was educated along with the white
children in the family.
""There were eight or ten slaves in all,"" Esther continued. ""We lived in
a house in the backyard of Captain King's Big House. My mamma was the
cook. Papa was a mechanic. He built houses and made tools and machinery.
Captain King gave me to the 'white lady;' that was Miss Susan, the
Captain's wife. Captain King was a fine man. He treated all of us just
like his own family. The 'white lady' taught us to be respectable and
truthful.""
When asked if she had ever been punished for misbehavior the old woman
smiled and said: ""Once the 'white lady' whipped me for playing with the
jailer's children. She had told me not to play with them because they
were not good company for me. She said that she wanted to raise me to be
good and truthful, and that the jailer's little white children told lies
and talked bad.""
Esther remembers well the mobilization of gray-uniformed troops at the
courthouse which stood only a block from the King residence. ""The town
was filled with soldiers for several days,"" she said. ""They assembled
about the courthouse and had speakings. One day I passed there with my
papa and saw Abraham Lincoln hanging from a noose in the courthouse
square. Of course, it was only an effigy of Abraham Lincoln which was
used to show what the soldiers thought of him. Papa told me that the
soldiers shot the effigy full of bullet holes before they left town.
""Before Captain King left he brought a man with him from the courthouse
to value his property. The slaves were valued, too. I remember Captain
King lifting me high above his head and saying to the man: 'I wouldn't
take a thousand dollars for this little gem.'""
She paused a moment. The light in her eyes showed that she was reliving
the thrill of that childhood incident.
""Then Captain King left with the other soldiers. Papa stayed and took
care of the 'white lady' and the house. After a while my brother ran
away and joined the troops to fight for Captain King. He came back after
the war, but Captain King did not. Several years later I saw a man down
in south Georgia who told me that he belonged to Captain King's troops.
He said that he was standing near him when he was killed.
Esther King Casey, Birmingham, Alabama
""After the proclamation the slaves were free. Most of them leased out to
plantation owners. I stayed with mamma and the 'white lady.'""
Mrs. King had taught the little slave girl to read and write, and when
schools were opened for the freed slaves she told the child's mother to
send her to school. Fees of fifty cents a month were charged, which
Mrs. King paid as long as the child remained with her. At eighteen years
of age the girl had acquired sufficient education to qualify to teach in
the public schools for Negroes. After three years of teaching she
married Jim Casey, an ex-slave, who took her to his ""three-plow"" farm in
south Georgia.
""No man ever lived who was finer than Jim,"" said the old woman. ""My
daughter used to say that I loved him more than God, and that God was
jealous and took him away from me.""
After her only daughter's death in 1919, Esther was brought to
Birmingham by her grandson who has kept her comfortably ever since. Her
hair is just turning gray, though she was born in 1856. The little briar
pipe, which she endeavors to conceal from strangers, is the only outward
evidence that she has anything in common with others of her
generation.","Interview with Esther King Casey

Interview with Henry Cheatam
-
Ila B. Prine
""White folks, I'se glad you drapped by to have a talk wid me. I was
gittin' powerfully lonely,"" said Henry Cheatam, who lives in Marysville,
a Mobile suburb. ""Sho' I'll be glad to tell you some about de slave
days. I sho' 'members plenty. Well, to begin wid, I was born in 1850
near West Point. Dat's in Clay County, Mississippi, you know. I b'longed
to Mr. Tom Hollingshead who was killed in de Cibil War. I 'members all
de slaves agoin' in to take a last look at him atter dey done brung his
body home.
""My mammy's name was Emmeline Cheatam, an' my pappy's was Sam Cheatam. I
don't remember my grandpappy an' grandmammy atall.
""Us slaves libed in log cabins what was daubed wid clay to keep de rain
an' win' out, an' de chimneys was made of clay an' sticks. De beds was
home-made an' nailed agin' de wall wid legs on de outer side. De Massa's
house was build of logs too, but it was much bigger'n de nigger cabins
an' sot way out in front of ourn. Atter de massa was kilt, old Miss had
a nigger oberseer an' dat was de meanest debil dat eber libbed on de
Lawd's green yearth. I promise myself when I growed up dat I was agoin'
to kill dat nigger iffen it was de las' thing I eber done. Lots of times
I'se seen him beat my mammy, an' one day I seen him beat my Auntie who
was big wid a chile, an' dat man dug a roun' hole in de groun' an' put
her stummick in it, an' beat an' beat her for a half hour straight till
the baby come out raght dere in de hole.
""Why de Mistis 'low such treatment? A heap of times ole Miss didn't know
nuthin' 'bout it, an' de slaves better not tell her, 'caze dat oberseer
whup 'em iffen he finds out dat dey done gone an' tol'. Yassun, white
folks, I'se seed some turrible things in my time. When de slaves would
try to run away our oberseer would put chains on dere legs wid big long
spikes tween dere feets, so dey couldn't git away. Den I's seen great
bunches of slaves put up on de block an' sol' jus' lak dey was cows.
Sometimes de chilluns would be seprated from dere maws an' paws.
""I come pretty near to bein' tuk away from my maw. When de slaves was
bein' 'vided, one of ole Miss' datters was agoin' to Texas, an' I was
goin' to have to go when somebody hollered 'Freedom', an' I sho' was
glad 'caze I could stay wid my mammy now.
""In dose days us had plenty of good, plain food; such as pot likker,
greens, cornbread, 'taters, peas, pears, an' at hog killin' us had
chittlin's an' pig jowls an' back bone. Den us would cotch 'possums at
night when dey come up in de corn fiel'. Us neber seed no flour dough.
""As for fishin', we neber did none, 'caze we hadda work too hard. We
worked from 'can to can't.' Git up at sunrise, go to de fiel' an' stay
till dark. In de middle of de day dey would sen' our somp'n t'eat to de
fiel' wid a barrel of water. But for breakfas' an' supper, us hadda cook
our own grub dey gib us.
""Our clo's warn't many. Us chilluns wo' a one-piece suit made outen
osnaburg, an' us would hab to take dat off at night, wash it an' put it
back on de nex' day. As for shoes, chillun neber had none. You see,
white folks, I was jus' a chile, jus' big enough to tote water to de
fiel's.
Henry Cheatam, Marysville, Alabama
""I 'members when de Yankees was acomin' th'ough I hoped to ca'y de
hosses to de woods an' hoped to hide de meat an' bury de valu'bles,
'caze dem Yankees tuk whatever dey wanted, an' you better not say
nothin' neither 'caze dey had dem long swyords ahangin' at dere sides.
""In dem days, de slaves done all de work an' carried all de news. De
marsters sont notes from one plantation to anudder, an' when dey wanted
de niggers to come to de Big House dey would blow an ole cow horn. Dey
had certain number of blows for certain niggers. Dat is, de niggers dat
was somp'n. Dey would also use dis horn for 'possum an' coon huntin' at
night. De li'l niggers at night went to de big house to spin an' weave.
I'se spun a many roll an' carded a many bat of cotton. I'se also made a
many tallow candle by tyin' strings onto a long stick an' droppin dem
down into moulds filled wid tallow. I'se hid many a night in de fence
corners when I'd be agoin' som'ers to git my mammy some 'bacco. De
pattyrollers would be out lookin' for slaves dat didn't hab no pass from
dere oberseer, an' I'd hear dem acomin' an' I'd hide till dey pass on,
'caze iffen dey cotch me I sho' gwine have a sound beatin'.
""De owners always tuk care of us, and when us got sick dey would git a
doctor, an' ole Miss was all right, but dat oberseer was a debil. He
wouldn't 'low no meetin' on de place. Sometimes us would slip down de
hill an' turn de wash pot bottom up'ards so de soun' of our voices would
go under de pot, an' us'd have a singin' an' prayin' raght dere.
""Mos' of de slave could go sometimes to de white folks church when dey
gits a pass from dere Massa, but dat mean oberseer always tried to keep
us from goin' so's us couldn't learn nothin'. He didn't want us to learn
to read or write neither.
""No'm us didn't have nothin' lak matches till I was growed. Us used
flint rocks an' cotton to start de fires.
""Us didn't have nothin' but food an' clothes. We didn't have no garden
of our own an' der wan't no celebratin', 'ceptin' at hog killin'. Dat
was de bigges' day of de year.
""On Sat'day afternoon we was 'lowed to play, but I can't 'member none of
de games. Us jus' played lak all li'l niggers did den. At night time us
jus' went to our cabins an' went to bed, 'caze we warn't 'lowed to do no
singing. Mos' of de singin' was done in de fiel's.
""Cornshuckin' time come when dey wanted to git de seed corn for
plantin', an' us would commence de shuckin' when it commence rainin'.
""You axed me 'bout funerals an' weddin's. Us niggers nebber ma'ied an'
don't 'member any big weddin's of de white folks. But dey buried folks
den de same as dey does now, in a box. Dey would bury de slaves same as
dey done de white folks, but us didn't eben have no babtizin' on 'count
of dat oberseer. He didn't lak for us to git no religion. Cose all
slaves didn't have hard treatment lak us did, 'caze dere oberseer an'
Marster warn't as mean as ourn.
""No'm we didn't know nothin' 'bout no hoodoo stuff in dem days. Dey only
had homemade medicines, dat is unless dey got sho' nuff powerful sick
an' den dey would go to see a doctor. Us used bone-set tea made from a
weed. Lawd, it was bitterer dan quinine, an' it were good for de chills
an' fever, an' it would purge you too. Den us used life-everlastin' tea
for fever, an' Jerusalem brush-reed to get rid of worms.
""But, Miss, I knows dere is gostes, 'caze when I was a little boy my
mammy come in from de fiel' an' laid across de bed an' I was sittin' in
front of de fireplace an' a big somp'n lak a cow widout no haid come in
de do' an' I commence to beat on it wid my fists. Den my mammy say:
'What matter wid you, nigger?' Den dat critter he walk raght out de
do'. I looked outen de window an' dere it was a-goin' in Aunt Marfa's
cabin. I neber did see it no mo'. Den anudder time a white man died an'
my mammy was a stayin' wid his sister an' dis spirit lak an angel come
to my mammy an' tol' her to tell de white lady to read de Bible
back'ards three times, 'caze dere was one talent 'tween her an' Jesus.
Atter dat she were comforted. Anudder time, my pappy, Sam Cheatam, who
was a wicked man, was a-sittin' in front of de fire an' a big brindle
dog come to de do' an' started barkin'. My pappy say: 'What in de Hell
am dat?' an' snapped his fingers at de dog. De dog he den dropped daid.
Some folks say dat dere ain't no sich things as gostes, but I know dere
is, 'caze dere is good spirits an' bad spirits.
""Dem was good ol' days, Mistis, even iffen us did have a hard time an' I
don't know iffen it warn't better'n it is now. I has to almos' go
hongry, an' I can't git no he'p from de government, 'caze I is over 65
years old. Fact is, I believe I 'druther be alivin' back dere dan today
'caze us at least had plenty somp'n t'eat an' nothin' to worry about.
An' as for beatin'; dey beats folks now iffen dey don't do raght, so
what's de difference? Yassum, Mistis, I worked as long as I was able an'
didn't axe nobody for nothin', but now it's diff'rent, 'caze I ain't
able to do no work. I'se tried to do raght and ain't never been in but
one fight in my life. I now belongs to de Corinthian Babtist Church, an'
I's tryin' to live so when de good Lawd calls I'll be ready to answer
wid a clean soul.
""I'se had two wives, but I was only a young nigger when I had de fust
un, an' had two chilluns by her, den I lef' her 'caze she warn't no
'count. Dat's been forty year ago, an' I ain't neber seen my chilluns in
all dem years. My second wife I got when I lived thirty miles below
Birmingham, Alabama, at de ol' Bank Mines. Dat's been thirty-five year
ago an' us is still together. Us ain't neber had no chilluns. No'm, I
don't know nothin' 'bout Abe Lincoln 'ceptin' dey say he sot us free,
an' I don't know nothin' 'bout dat neither.""","Interview with Henry Cheatam

Interview with Esther King Casey
-
Edward F. Harper, Birmingham
Less vivid in her memory are the stories told her by her grandmother
of a long voyage across the ocean, of the arrival in a new land
called Mobile, and of slaves being sold at public auction. Less vivid,
too, are the memories of her own journey to Georgia, where she, with
her parents and brother, were brought to be the slaves of Captain King.
""I was only four or five years old when we came to Captain King's big
house,"" said the old woman, brightening with pride in her ability to
recollect. Her manners bore the marks of culture and refinement, and her
speech was surprisingly void of the usual Negro dialect. She is an
example of the former slave who was educated along with the white
children in the family.
""There were eight or ten slaves in all,"" Esther continued. ""We lived in
a house in the backyard of Captain King's Big House. My mamma was the
cook. Papa was a mechanic. He built houses and made tools and machinery.
Captain King gave me to the 'white lady;' that was Miss Susan, the
Captain's wife. Captain King was a fine man. He treated all of us just
like his own family. The 'white lady' taught us to be respectable and
truthful.""
When asked if she had ever been punished for misbehavior the old woman
smiled and said: ""Once the 'white lady' whipped me for playing with the
jailer's children. She had told me not to play with them because they
were not good company for me. She said that she wanted to raise me to be
good and truthful, and that the jailer's little white children told lies
and talked bad.""
Esther remembers well the mobilization of gray-uniformed troops at the
courthouse which stood only a block from the King residence. ""The town
was filled with soldiers for several days,"" she said. ""They assembled
about the courthouse and had speakings. One day I passed there with my
papa and saw Abraham Lincoln hanging from a noose in the courthouse
square. Of course, it was only an effigy of Abraham Lincoln which was
used to show what the soldiers thought of him. Papa told me that the
soldiers shot the effigy full of bullet holes before they left town.
""Before Captain King left he brought a man with him from the courthouse
to value his property. The slaves were valued, too. I remember Captain
King lifting me high above his head and saying to the man: 'I wouldn't
take a thousand dollars for this little gem.'""
She paused a moment. The light in her eyes showed that she was reliving
the thrill of that childhood incident.
""Then Captain King left with the other soldiers. Papa stayed and took
care of the 'white lady' and the house. After a while my brother ran
away and joined the troops to fight for Captain King. He came back after
the war, but Captain King did not. Several years later I saw a man down
in south Georgia who told me that he belonged to Captain King's troops.
He said that he was standing near him when he was killed.
Esther King Casey, Birmingham, Alabama
""After the proclamation the slaves were free. Most of them leased out to
plantation owners. I stayed with mamma and the 'white lady.'""
Mrs. King had taught the little slave girl to read and write, and when
schools were opened for the freed slaves she told the child's mother to
send her to school. Fees of fifty cents a month were charged, which
Mrs. King paid as long as the child remained with her. At eighteen years
of age the girl had acquired sufficient education to qualify to teach in
the public schools for Negroes. After three years of teaching she
married Jim Casey, an ex-slave, who took her to his ""three-plow"" farm in
south Georgia.
""No man ever lived who was finer than Jim,"" said the old woman. ""My
daughter used to say that I loved him more than God, and that God was
jealous and took him away from me.""
After her only daughter's death in 1919, Esther was brought to
Birmingham by her grandson who has kept her comfortably ever since. Her
hair is just turning gray, though she was born in 1856. The little briar
pipe, which she endeavors to conceal from strangers, is the only outward
evidence that she has anything in common with others of her
generation.","Interview with Esther King Casey

Interview with Henry Cheatam
-
Ila B. Prine
""White folks, I'se glad you drapped by to have a talk wid me. I was
gittin' powerfully lonely,"" said Henry Cheatam, who lives in Marysville,
a Mobile suburb. ""Sho' I'll be glad to tell you some about de slave
days. I sho' 'members plenty. Well, to begin wid, I was born in 1850
near West Point. Dat's in Clay County, Mississippi, you know. I b'longed
to Mr. Tom Hollingshead who was killed in de Cibil War. I 'members all
de slaves agoin' in to take a last look at him atter dey done brung his
body home.
""My mammy's name was Emmeline Cheatam, an' my pappy's was Sam Cheatam. I
don't remember my grandpappy an' grandmammy atall.
""Us slaves libed in log cabins what was daubed wid clay to keep de rain
an' win' out, an' de chimneys was made of clay an' sticks. De beds was
home-made an' nailed agin' de wall wid legs on de outer side. De Massa's
house was build of logs too, but it was much bigger'n de nigger cabins
an' sot way out in front of ourn. Atter de massa was kilt, old Miss had
a nigger oberseer an' dat was de meanest debil dat eber libbed on de
Lawd's green yearth. I promise myself when I growed up dat I was agoin'
to kill dat nigger iffen it was de las' thing I eber done. Lots of times
I'se seen him beat my mammy, an' one day I seen him beat my Auntie who
was big wid a chile, an' dat man dug a roun' hole in de groun' an' put
her stummick in it, an' beat an' beat her for a half hour straight till
the baby come out raght dere in de hole.
""Why de Mistis 'low such treatment? A heap of times ole Miss didn't know
nuthin' 'bout it, an' de slaves better not tell her, 'caze dat oberseer
whup 'em iffen he finds out dat dey done gone an' tol'. Yassun, white
folks, I'se seed some turrible things in my time. When de slaves would
try to run away our oberseer would put chains on dere legs wid big long
spikes tween dere feets, so dey couldn't git away. Den I's seen great
bunches of slaves put up on de block an' sol' jus' lak dey was cows.
Sometimes de chilluns would be seprated from dere maws an' paws.
""I come pretty near to bein' tuk away from my maw. When de slaves was
bein' 'vided, one of ole Miss' datters was agoin' to Texas, an' I was
goin' to have to go when somebody hollered 'Freedom', an' I sho' was
glad 'caze I could stay wid my mammy now.
""In dose days us had plenty of good, plain food; such as pot likker,
greens, cornbread, 'taters, peas, pears, an' at hog killin' us had
chittlin's an' pig jowls an' back bone. Den us would cotch 'possums at
night when dey come up in de corn fiel'. Us neber seed no flour dough.
""As for fishin', we neber did none, 'caze we hadda work too hard. We
worked from 'can to can't.' Git up at sunrise, go to de fiel' an' stay
till dark. In de middle of de day dey would sen' our somp'n t'eat to de
fiel' wid a barrel of water. But for breakfas' an' supper, us hadda cook
our own grub dey gib us.
""Our clo's warn't many. Us chilluns wo' a one-piece suit made outen
osnaburg, an' us would hab to take dat off at night, wash it an' put it
back on de nex' day. As for shoes, chillun neber had none. You see,
white folks, I was jus' a chile, jus' big enough to tote water to de
fiel's.
Henry Cheatam, Marysville, Alabama
""I 'members when de Yankees was acomin' th'ough I hoped to ca'y de
hosses to de woods an' hoped to hide de meat an' bury de valu'bles,
'caze dem Yankees tuk whatever dey wanted, an' you better not say
nothin' neither 'caze dey had dem long swyords ahangin' at dere sides.
""In dem days, de slaves done all de work an' carried all de news. De
marsters sont notes from one plantation to anudder, an' when dey wanted
de niggers to come to de Big House dey would blow an ole cow horn. Dey
had certain number of blows for certain niggers. Dat is, de niggers dat
was somp'n. Dey would also use dis horn for 'possum an' coon huntin' at
night. De li'l niggers at night went to de big house to spin an' weave.
I'se spun a many roll an' carded a many bat of cotton. I'se also made a
many tallow candle by tyin' strings onto a long stick an' droppin dem
down into moulds filled wid tallow. I'se hid many a night in de fence
corners when I'd be agoin' som'ers to git my mammy some 'bacco. De
pattyrollers would be out lookin' for slaves dat didn't hab no pass from
dere oberseer, an' I'd hear dem acomin' an' I'd hide till dey pass on,
'caze iffen dey cotch me I sho' gwine have a sound beatin'.
""De owners always tuk care of us, and when us got sick dey would git a
doctor, an' ole Miss was all right, but dat oberseer was a debil. He
wouldn't 'low no meetin' on de place. Sometimes us would slip down de
hill an' turn de wash pot bottom up'ards so de soun' of our voices would
go under de pot, an' us'd have a singin' an' prayin' raght dere.
""Mos' of de slave could go sometimes to de white folks church when dey
gits a pass from dere Massa, but dat mean oberseer always tried to keep
us from goin' so's us couldn't learn nothin'. He didn't want us to learn
to read or write neither.
""No'm us didn't have nothin' lak matches till I was growed. Us used
flint rocks an' cotton to start de fires.
""Us didn't have nothin' but food an' clothes. We didn't have no garden
of our own an' der wan't no celebratin', 'ceptin' at hog killin'. Dat
was de bigges' day of de year.
""On Sat'day afternoon we was 'lowed to play, but I can't 'member none of
de games. Us jus' played lak all li'l niggers did den. At night time us
jus' went to our cabins an' went to bed, 'caze we warn't 'lowed to do no
singing. Mos' of de singin' was done in de fiel's.
""Cornshuckin' time come when dey wanted to git de seed corn for
plantin', an' us would commence de shuckin' when it commence rainin'.
""You axed me 'bout funerals an' weddin's. Us niggers nebber ma'ied an'
don't 'member any big weddin's of de white folks. But dey buried folks
den de same as dey does now, in a box. Dey would bury de slaves same as
dey done de white folks, but us didn't eben have no babtizin' on 'count
of dat oberseer. He didn't lak for us to git no religion. Cose all
slaves didn't have hard treatment lak us did, 'caze dere oberseer an'
Marster warn't as mean as ourn.
""No'm we didn't know nothin' 'bout no hoodoo stuff in dem days. Dey only
had homemade medicines, dat is unless dey got sho' nuff powerful sick
an' den dey would go to see a doctor. Us used bone-set tea made from a
weed. Lawd, it was bitterer dan quinine, an' it were good for de chills
an' fever, an' it would purge you too. Den us used life-everlastin' tea
for fever, an' Jerusalem brush-reed to get rid of worms.
""But, Miss, I knows dere is gostes, 'caze when I was a little boy my
mammy come in from de fiel' an' laid across de bed an' I was sittin' in
front of de fireplace an' a big somp'n lak a cow widout no haid come in
de do' an' I commence to beat on it wid my fists. Den my mammy say:
'What matter wid you, nigger?' Den dat critter he walk raght out de
do'. I looked outen de window an' dere it was a-goin' in Aunt Marfa's
cabin. I neber did see it no mo'. Den anudder time a white man died an'
my mammy was a stayin' wid his sister an' dis spirit lak an angel come
to my mammy an' tol' her to tell de white lady to read de Bible
back'ards three times, 'caze dere was one talent 'tween her an' Jesus.
Atter dat she were comforted. Anudder time, my pappy, Sam Cheatam, who
was a wicked man, was a-sittin' in front of de fire an' a big brindle
dog come to de do' an' started barkin'. My pappy say: 'What in de Hell
am dat?' an' snapped his fingers at de dog. De dog he den dropped daid.
Some folks say dat dere ain't no sich things as gostes, but I know dere
is, 'caze dere is good spirits an' bad spirits.
""Dem was good ol' days, Mistis, even iffen us did have a hard time an' I
don't know iffen it warn't better'n it is now. I has to almos' go
hongry, an' I can't git no he'p from de government, 'caze I is over 65
years old. Fact is, I believe I 'druther be alivin' back dere dan today
'caze us at least had plenty somp'n t'eat an' nothin' to worry about.
An' as for beatin'; dey beats folks now iffen dey don't do raght, so
what's de difference? Yassum, Mistis, I worked as long as I was able an'
didn't axe nobody for nothin', but now it's diff'rent, 'caze I ain't
able to do no work. I'se tried to do raght and ain't never been in but
one fight in my life. I now belongs to de Corinthian Babtist Church, an'
I's tryin' to live so when de good Lawd calls I'll be ready to answer
wid a clean soul.
""I'se had two wives, but I was only a young nigger when I had de fust
un, an' had two chilluns by her, den I lef' her 'caze she warn't no
'count. Dat's been forty year ago, an' I ain't neber seen my chilluns in
all dem years. My second wife I got when I lived thirty miles below
Birmingham, Alabama, at de ol' Bank Mines. Dat's been thirty-five year
ago an' us is still together. Us ain't neber had no chilluns. No'm, I
don't know nothin' 'bout Abe Lincoln 'ceptin' dey say he sot us free,
an' I don't know nothin' 'bout dat neither.""","Interview with Henry Cheatam

Interview with Esther King Casey
-
Edward F. Harper, Birmingham
Less vivid in her memory are the stories told her by her grandmother
of a long voyage across the ocean, of the arrival in a new land
called Mobile, and of slaves being sold at public auction. Less vivid,
too, are the memories of her own journey to Georgia, where she, with
her parents and brother, were brought to be the slaves of Captain King.
""I was only four or five years old when we came to Captain King's big
house,"" said the old woman, brightening with pride in her ability to
recollect. Her manners bore the marks of culture and refinement, and her
speech was surprisingly void of the usual Negro dialect. She is an
example of the former slave who was educated along with the white
children in the family.
""There were eight or ten slaves in all,"" Esther continued. ""We lived in
a house in the backyard of Captain King's Big House. My mamma was the
cook. Papa was a mechanic. He built houses and made tools and machinery.
Captain King gave me to the 'white lady;' that was Miss Susan, the
Captain's wife. Captain King was a fine man. He treated all of us just
like his own family. The 'white lady' taught us to be respectable and
truthful.""
When asked if she had ever been punished for misbehavior the old woman
smiled and said: ""Once the 'white lady' whipped me for playing with the
jailer's children. She had told me not to play with them because they
were not good company for me. She said that she wanted to raise me to be
good and truthful, and that the jailer's little white children told lies
and talked bad.""
Esther remembers well the mobilization of gray-uniformed troops at the
courthouse which stood only a block from the King residence. ""The town
was filled with soldiers for several days,"" she said. ""They assembled
about the courthouse and had speakings. One day I passed there with my
papa and saw Abraham Lincoln hanging from a noose in the courthouse
square. Of course, it was only an effigy of Abraham Lincoln which was
used to show what the soldiers thought of him. Papa told me that the
soldiers shot the effigy full of bullet holes before they left town.
""Before Captain King left he brought a man with him from the courthouse
to value his property. The slaves were valued, too. I remember Captain
King lifting me high above his head and saying to the man: 'I wouldn't
take a thousand dollars for this little gem.'""
She paused a moment. The light in her eyes showed that she was reliving
the thrill of that childhood incident.
""Then Captain King left with the other soldiers. Papa stayed and took
care of the 'white lady' and the house. After a while my brother ran
away and joined the troops to fight for Captain King. He came back after
the war, but Captain King did not. Several years later I saw a man down
in south Georgia who told me that he belonged to Captain King's troops.
He said that he was standing near him when he was killed.

""After the proclamation the slaves were free. Most of them leased out to
plantation owners. I stayed with mamma and the 'white lady.'""
Mrs. King had taught the little slave girl to read and write, and when
schools were opened for the freed slaves she told the child's mother to
send her to school. Fees of fifty cents a month were charged, which
Mrs. King paid as long as the child remained with her. At eighteen years
of age the girl had acquired sufficient education to qualify to teach in
the public schools for Negroes. After three years of teaching she
married Jim Casey, an ex-slave, who took her to his ""three-plow"" farm in
south Georgia.
""No man ever lived who was finer than Jim,"" said the old woman. ""My
daughter used to say that I loved him more than God, and that God was
jealous and took him away from me.""
After her only daughter's death in 1919, Esther was brought to
Birmingham by her grandson who has kept her comfortably ever since. Her
hair is just turning gray, though she was born in 1856. The little briar
pipe, which she endeavors to conceal from strangers, is the only outward
evidence that she has anything in common with others of her
generation.","Interview with Esther King Casey

Interview with Henry Cheatam

Ila B. Prine
""White folks, I'se glad you drapped by to have a talk wid me. I was
gittin' powerfully lonely,"" said Henry Cheatam, who lives in Marysville,
a Mobile suburb. ""Sho' I'll be glad to tell you some about de slave
days. I sho' 'members plenty. Well, to begin wid, I was born in 1850
near West Point. Dat's in Clay County, Mississippi, you know. I b'longed
to Mr. Tom Hollingshead who was killed in de Cibil War. I 'members all
de slaves agoin' in to take a last look at him atter dey done brung his
body home.
""My mammy's name was Emmeline Cheatam, an' my pappy's was Sam Cheatam. I
don't remember my grandpappy an' grandmammy atall.
""Us slaves libed in log cabins what was daubed wid clay to keep de rain
an' win' out, an' de chimneys was made of clay an' sticks. De beds was
home-made an' nailed agin' de wall wid legs on de outer side. De Massa's
house was build of logs too, but it was much bigger'n de nigger cabins
an' sot way out in front of ourn. Atter de massa was kilt, old Miss had
a nigger oberseer an' dat was de meanest debil dat eber libbed on de
Lawd's green yearth. I promise myself when I growed up dat I was agoin'
to kill dat nigger iffen it was de las' thing I eber done. Lots of times
I'se seen him beat my mammy, an' one day I seen him beat my Auntie who
was big wid a chile, an' dat man dug a roun' hole in de groun' an' put
her stummick in it, an' beat an' beat her for a half hour straight till
the baby come out raght dere in de hole.
""Why de Mistis 'low such treatment? A heap of times ole Miss didn't know
nuthin' 'bout it, an' de slaves better not tell her, 'caze dat oberseer
whup 'em iffen he finds out dat dey done gone an' tol'. Yassun, white
folks, I'se seed some turrible things in my time. When de slaves would
try to run away our oberseer would put chains on dere legs wid big long
spikes tween dere feets, so dey couldn't git away. Den I's seen great
bunches of slaves put up on de block an' sol' jus' lak dey was cows.
Sometimes de chilluns would be seprated from dere maws an' paws.
""I come pretty near to bein' tuk away from my maw. When de slaves was
bein' 'vided, one of ole Miss' datters was agoin' to Texas, an' I was
goin' to have to go when somebody hollered 'Freedom', an' I sho' was
glad 'caze I could stay wid my mammy now.
""In dose days us had plenty of good, plain food; such as pot likker,
greens, cornbread, 'taters, peas, pears, an' at hog killin' us had
chittlin's an' pig jowls an' back bone. Den us would cotch 'possums at
night when dey come up in de corn fiel'. Us neber seed no flour dough.
""As for fishin', we neber did none, 'caze we hadda work too hard. We
worked from 'can to can't.' Git up at sunrise, go to de fiel' an' stay
till dark. In de middle of de day dey would sen' our somp'n t'eat to de
fiel' wid a barrel of water. But for breakfas' an' supper, us hadda cook
our own grub dey gib us.
""Our clo's warn't many. Us chilluns wo' a one-piece suit made outen
osnaburg, an' us would hab to take dat off at night, wash it an' put it
back on de nex' day. As for shoes, chillun neber had none. You see,
white folks, I was jus' a chile, jus' big enough to tote water to de
fiel's.
Henry Cheatam, Marysville, Alabama
""I 'members when de Yankees was acomin' th'ough I hoped to ca'y de
hosses to de woods an' hoped to hide de meat an' bury de valu'bles,
'caze dem Yankees tuk whatever dey wanted, an' you better not say
nothin' neither 'caze dey had dem long swyords ahangin' at dere sides.
""In dem days, de slaves done all de work an' carried all de news. De
marsters sont notes from one plantation to anudder, an' when dey wanted
de niggers to come to de Big House dey would blow an ole cow horn. Dey
had certain number of blows for certain niggers. Dat is, de niggers dat
was somp'n. Dey would also use dis horn for 'possum an' coon huntin' at
night. De li'l niggers at night went to de big house to spin an' weave.
I'se spun a many roll an' carded a many bat of cotton. I'se also made a
many tallow candle by tyin' strings onto a long stick an' droppin dem
down into moulds filled wid tallow. I'se hid many a night in de fence
corners when I'd be agoin' som'ers to git my mammy some 'bacco. De
pattyrollers would be out lookin' for slaves dat didn't hab no pass from
dere oberseer, an' I'd hear dem acomin' an' I'd hide till dey pass on,
'caze iffen dey cotch me I sho' gwine have a sound beatin'.
""De owners always tuk care of us, and when us got sick dey would git a
doctor, an' ole Miss was all right, but dat oberseer was a debil. He
wouldn't 'low no meetin' on de place. Sometimes us would slip down de
hill an' turn de wash pot bottom up'ards so de soun' of our voices would
go under de pot, an' us'd have a singin' an' prayin' raght dere.
""Mos' of de slave could go sometimes to de white folks church when dey
gits a pass from dere Massa, but dat mean oberseer always tried to keep
us from goin' so's us couldn't learn nothin'. He didn't want us to learn
to read or write neither.
""No'm us didn't have nothin' lak matches till I was growed. Us used
flint rocks an' cotton to start de fires.
""Us didn't have nothin' but food an' clothes. We didn't have no garden
of our own an' der wan't no celebratin', 'ceptin' at hog killin'. Dat
was de bigges' day of de year.
""On Sat'day afternoon we was 'lowed to play, but I can't 'member none of
de games. Us jus' played lak all li'l niggers did den. At night time us
jus' went to our cabins an' went to bed, 'caze we warn't 'lowed to do no
singing. Mos' of de singin' was done in de fiel's.
""Cornshuckin' time come when dey wanted to git de seed corn for
plantin', an' us would commence de shuckin' when it commence rainin'.
""You axed me 'bout funerals an' weddin's. Us niggers nebber ma'ied an'
don't 'member any big weddin's of de white folks. But dey buried folks
den de same as dey does now, in a box. Dey would bury de slaves same as
dey done de white folks, but us didn't eben have no babtizin' on 'count
of dat oberseer. He didn't lak for us to git no religion. Cose all
slaves didn't have hard treatment lak us did, 'caze dere oberseer an'
Marster warn't as mean as ourn.
""No'm we didn't know nothin' 'bout no hoodoo stuff in dem days. Dey only
had homemade medicines, dat is unless dey got sho' nuff powerful sick
an' den dey would go to see a doctor. Us used bone-set tea made from a
weed. Lawd, it was bitterer dan quinine, an' it were good for de chills
an' fever, an' it would purge you too. Den us used life-everlastin' tea
for fever, an' Jerusalem brush-reed to get rid of worms.
""But, Miss, I knows dere is gostes, 'caze when I was a little boy my
mammy come in from de fiel' an' laid across de bed an' I was sittin' in
front of de fireplace an' a big somp'n lak a cow widout no haid come in
de do' an' I commence to beat on it wid my fists. Den my mammy say:
'What matter wid you, nigger?' Den dat critter he walk raght out de
do'. I looked outen de window an' dere it was a-goin' in Aunt Marfa's
cabin. I neber did see it no mo'. Den anudder time a white man died an'
my mammy was a stayin' wid his sister an' dis spirit lak an angel come
to my mammy an' tol' her to tell de white lady to read de Bible
back'ards three times, 'caze dere was one talent 'tween her an' Jesus.
Atter dat she were comforted. Anudder time, my pappy, Sam Cheatam, who
was a wicked man, was a-sittin' in front of de fire an' a big brindle
dog come to de do' an' started barkin'. My pappy say: 'What in de Hell
am dat?' an' snapped his fingers at de dog. De dog he den dropped daid.
Some folks say dat dere ain't no sich things as gostes, but I know dere
is, 'caze dere is good spirits an' bad spirits.
""Dem was good ol' days, Mistis, even iffen us did have a hard time an' I
don't know iffen it warn't better'n it is now. I has to almos' go
hongry, an' I can't git no he'p from de government, 'caze I is over 65
years old. Fact is, I believe I 'druther be alivin' back dere dan today
'caze us at least had plenty somp'n t'eat an' nothin' to worry about.
An' as for beatin'; dey beats folks now iffen dey don't do raght, so
what's de difference? Yassum, Mistis, I worked as long as I was able an'
didn't axe nobody for nothin', but now it's diff'rent, 'caze I ain't
able to do no work. I'se tried to do raght and ain't never been in but
one fight in my life. I now belongs to de Corinthian Babtist Church, an'
I's tryin' to live so when de good Lawd calls I'll be ready to answer
wid a clean soul.
""I'se had two wives, but I was only a young nigger when I had de fust
un, an' had two chilluns by her, den I lef' her 'caze she warn't no
'count. Dat's been forty year ago, an' I ain't neber seen my chilluns in
all dem years. My second wife I got when I lived thirty miles below
Birmingham, Alabama, at de ol' Bank Mines. Dat's been thirty-five year
ago an' us is still together. Us ain't neber had no chilluns. No'm, I
don't know nothin' 'bout Abe Lincoln 'ceptin' dey say he sot us free,
an' I don't know nothin' 'bout dat neither.""","Interview with Henry Cheatam

I walked along a dusty road under the blazing sun. In the shade of a
willow tree a Negro man was seated with his legs drawn up and his arms
crossed upon his knees. His head rested face downward upon his arms, as
he had the aspect of one in deep slumber. Beside him munching on a few
straggly weeds, a cantankerous mule took little notice of his
surroundings.
""Can you tell me where Aunt Molly Ammonds lives?"" I asked in a loud
voice. The Negro stirred slowly, finally raising his head, and
displaying three rabbit teeth, he accompanied his answer with a slight
gesture of his hand.
""Yassuh, dar her house raght across de road; de house wid de climbin'
roses on hit.""
""Thank you,"" I said.
""Yassuh,"" was the drawled response, and the Negro quickly resumed his
former posture.
Aunt Molly Ammonds is as gentle as a little child. Her voice is soft and
each phrase measured to the slow functionings of her aged mind.
Molly Ammond (Ammonds), Eufaula, Alabama
""Honey,"" she said, ""you ain't gwineter believe dis, but I is de mammy of
thirty chilluns. Jesus got 'em counted an' so is me. I was born in a log
cabin dat had a loft, an' it was on Marse Lee Cato's plantation five
miles wes' of Eufaula. My pappy's name was Tobe Cato an' my mammy's was
Sophia. I had one sister, Marthy, an' two brothers, Bong and Toge. My
pappy made all de furniture dat went in our house an' it were might'
good furniture too. Us useta cook on de fiahplace. Us would cook ash
cakes. Dey was made outen meal, water and a little pinch of lard; on
Sundays dey was made outen flour, buttermilk an' lard. Mammy would rake
all de ashes out de fiahplace, den kivver de cake wid de hot ashes an'
let it cool till it was done.
""Yas Missy,"" she continued, ""I recollects dat I was 'bout twelve or
fo'teen when de s'render come, kaze a little atter dat I ma'ied Pastor
Ammonds. We walked ober to Georgetown an' it was de fus' time I eber had
shoes, and I got dem fum ole Massa. I remembers dat I ma'ied in a
striped calico dress.""
""Aunt Molly,"" I said, ""you're getting a little ahead of your story, tell
me something about your plantation life before the war.""
""Well, honey, Massa Lee's place was 'bout three miles long an' two miles
wide, and we raised cotton, cawn, 'taters and all sorts of vegetables.
We had a mean oberseer dat always wanted to whup us, but massa wouldn't
'llow no whuppin'. Sometimes de massa whould ride over de place on a
hoss, an' when he come up on de oberseer a-fussin' at a nigger, Massa
say, 'Don't talk rough to dat nigger when he doin' de bes' he can.'
""My pappy had a little garden of his own back of his cabin, an' he
raised some chickens for us to eat, an' we had aigs nearly ev'y mornin'.
""De only work I done on de plantation was to nuss some little niggers
when dere mammy an' pappy was in de fiel's. Twarn't hard.
""Nawsuh! I ain't never seed no slave in chains. Massa Lee was a good
man. He had a church built called de brush house, dat had a flo' and
some seats, an' a top made outen pine boughs, an' massa's pa, Mr. Cato,
would preach eve'y Sunday. We sung songs lak 'I Heered De Voice of Jesus
Say,' an' 'I'se Gwine to Die no Mo.' We was all babtized in de creek,
but none of us was taught to read or write.
""No-suh, I ain't never seed no slave run away. Us was treated fine. Our
folks was quality. We had plenty som'n t'eat, but dem slaves hadda work
powerful hard though. Atter dey come home fum de fiel's dey was so
tired dat dey go raght to sleep, except when de massa had barbecues.
Christmas was de big time; dere was several days to res' an' make
merryin' an' lots of dem no count niggers got drunk.
""When us slaves was sick, Massa Lee would send to Eufaula to fetch Dr.
Thornton to give us some medicine. We had de bes' treatment ever.
""Yassuh, white folks, dem days is long ago. All my chilluns done died or
wandered away an' my ole man been dead goin' on twenty years. I been
here a long time by myself.""
""Aunt Molly,"" I interrupted. ""There's one thing I've always been wanting
to ask one of you ex-slaves, and that is: what you thought of people
like Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis and Booker T. Washington.""
A puzzled expression came of the face of the old Negro. ""White folks,""
she said after a moments deliberation, ""I don't believes I is had de
pleasure of meetin' dem gent'mens.""","Interview with Molly Ammond (Ammonds)

Interview with Matilda Pugh Daniel

Near Eufaula, Alabama, on a bluff stands a little three room cabin
neatly furnished with plain, well worn, but nicely kept furniture.
Surrounding the house are small beds of pretty flowers, and rows of
fresh vegetables. Here resides in peace and tranquility Aunt Matilda
Pugh Daniel, an old Negro slave, aged 96 years. Aunt Matilda was a full
grown buxom gal when the War between the States was raging. She belonged
to United States Senator, James L. Pugh, and was born on his plantation,
near Eufaula. Even though time has dimmed her sight, and slightly
diminished her hearing powers, she is still active of mind and accurate
in her memories. We will let her speak for herself:
""Yassuh, white folks, I remembers lots of things dat happen in de
slabery times. I works aroun' de house for mistis, who was de daughter
of Gen'l John Linguard Hunter befo' she ma'ied de massa. When I was a
little pig-tailed nigger, I usta play 'roun' wid Massa's chilluns. We
play injuns in de woods, an' buil' dams down on de creek an' swing in de
yard an' sometime we sho do devilish things. We hid red pepper in ole
Black Bob's chewin' bacca, an' you ought to seed de faces he made. It
makes me laugh still yit. Den we tuken a skunk dat us little white an'
black debils kotched an' turn him loose in de slave quarters. You ought
ter seed dem niggers come a flyin' outer dere. Dey come out like a swarm
of wet antses.
""Atter I grew up I ma'ied Joe Daniel, a house nigger, an' Gen'l Hunter,
de Mistis's pappy 'formed de ceremony. We was ma'ied in de parlor, an' I
wo' a party dress of Miss Sara's. It sho' was purty; made outen white
tarleton wid a pink bow in de front. I had a pink ribbon 'roun' my haid
too, an' Joe, he look proud of me. Atter de weddin' all de niggers on de
plantation gathered about an' we had a soiree in de back yard. Me an'
Joe moved to de quarter den, but I still worked in de house. Mistis
warn't goin' ter let nobody wash dem julep glasses but me, an' warn't
nobody a goin' ter polish dat silber but dis here nigger. Nawsuh.
Matilda Pugh Daniel, Eufaula, Alabama
""Durin' de war us warn't bothered much, but atter de surrender, some po'
white trash tried to make us take some lan'. Some of 'em come to de
slave quarters, an' talk to us. Dey say 'Niggers, you is jus' as good as
de white fo'ks. You is 'titled to vote in de 'lections an' to have money
same as dey,' but most of us didn't pay no 'tention to 'em.
""Den Massa James an' Mistis moved to Washington, an' Miss Sara wanted me
to go wid her to be her house maid. She said she'd pay me money fo' it,
but I couldn't leave my ole man, Joe, kaze he had a case of consumption.
Joe died a year later an' lef' me wid fo' little chilluns. Us stayed
'roun' on de plantation an' de new massa paid us good money fo' workin',
but soon de house kotched fire an' burn to de groun', an' I have to move
to Eufaula. I bought dis little house wid de money I saved. I has
kinfolks in Detroit dat sen's me a little money, an' some good peoples
in Eufaula helps me out some so I is in purty good financial shape. I
ain't neber 'sociated wid no trashy niggers an' I ain't neber 'ten' to.
I is goin' to be a proud an' good nigger to de las'.""","Interview with Matilda Pugh Daniel

Interview with Gabe Hines

Gertha Couric
Old Gabe had been long in this world-close to one hundred years. He had
experienced much but one incident had out-lasted all the others-even
the stroke that made him older and more feeble. That experience had
caused Gabe and his ""ole woman"" to stray far from the fold and to walk
all the way back to its shelter.
That was back in Reconstruction days, when he was not ""bandy in his
knees"" and long before Anna left him alone in his cabin with just
memories of earlier and happier days.
Gabe was ""birthed in Cusseta, Georgia,"" the son of two faithful old
slaves, Hetty and Gabe Hines, and they ""all 'longed to Marsa William
Shipp an' Miss Ma'y. He told his story thus:
""Endurin' of de Wah, I was big enough to be water toter on de
plantation. No, Li'l Missy, I doan' 'zactly know how old I is 'ceptin'
by de squeakin' an' achin' of my bones. I 'members lots 'bout doze days.
Dem was happy times, Li'l Missy. Arter we all was freed, I went to
Silver Run to live and dar I mahied Anna. She lef' me nine yeahs ago an'
that broke the happiness. I miss her ev'whar, jes' keep a-missin' her
though nine yeahs hev gone since dey tuk her from de cabin an' lef' her
up thar on de hill. Dere's nights when de mis'ry in dese ol' bones jist
gits past standin' an' on sich nights she come ter me and holp me wid de
linnymint jes' as she useter do. But she caint stay long when she come.
""I was a-tellin' 'bout Silver Run. Arter we was mahied and was gittin'
use to bein' free niggahs, an' happy in our cabin, one night a gen'ulman
from de no'th was to see us an' he tol' us if we'd go wid him he'd pay
us big wages an' gin us a fine house to boot.
""Fer two nights we sot dere by dat chimbly a-thinkin' a sight to do or
to don't and ponderin' this way and t'other one. Den we 'cided to go. We
lef ev'y thing dar 'ceptin' whut we tied up in a bandana han'chief, and
we tied that onto a stick for de gen'ulman from de no'th wouldn't let us
take no baggage. We was goin' to Columbus, Georgia, but we didn't know
dat.
""Li'l Missy, when we got dar, whar he was a-takin' us, we foun' the big
wages to be fifty cents a month, and dat fine house tu'ned out to be mo'
like a stable. Instid of our cabin and gyarden and chickens and our
trees, we had a turrible place, right out under the hot sun wid watah
miles away down a hill. And he wan't no gent'man from de no'th!
""Missy, I nebber will be able to tell myself whut made us do hit no mo'
den I'll ebber be able to tell how skeered I was one night when de wind
howled an' de lightnin' was sprayin' ober de place an' de rain was so
turrible hit was a-sobbin' in de fire. We knowed de debbil was ridin' de
win' dat night.
""We was a-sittin' dar befo' de fire, me an' my ol' woman, when we heard
a stompin' like a million horses had stopped outside de do'. We tipped
to de do' an' peeked out an', li'l Missy, whut we seed was so turrible
our eyes jes' mos' popped out our haid. Dere was a million hosses all
kivered in white, wid dey eyes pokin' out and a-settin' on de hosses was
men kivered in white too, tall as giants, an' dey eyes was a-pokin' out
too. Dere was a leader an' he heldt a bu'nin' cross in his hand.
""When we seed dat, we fell on our po' knees, skeered mos' to def an' we
axed de Great Marster to holp two po' ol' niggers an' holp 'em quick.
""De fust thing we knowed dem Ku Kluxes had de gen'man from de no'th out
of his hidin' place 'hind our house an' a-settin' on one of dem hosses.
Dey nebber spoke wid him. Dey jes' tuk him off somewhar, we nebber
knowed whar, but he di'n't come back no mo'.
""Li'l Missy, we heard arterwards dat dis gen'lman from de no'th was no
qual'ty a-tall. Dat he was de wu'st leadah of all de debilment bein'
done; one of dem carpet-baggin' men.
""Nex' day arter de Ku Kluxes cotched dis man, his wife lef' Columbus in
a hurry, sayin' she couldn't sociate wid de Columbus ladies 'caze dey
was so po'. Dey wa po'! Dey is no denyin' that. We was all po' caze the
Yankees done ruint Columbus. But, li'l Missy, dey's a big dif'ence in
bein' po' an' qual'ty and' bein' jes po' white trash.
Gabe Hines, Eufaula, Alabama
""What did I do then? Well, li'l Missy, we lef' Columbus arter whut
happen'd an' we walked to Eufaula, whar twas safe to be. For forty yeahs
I w'uked for de city and Anna, she tuk in washin'. Endurin' dat time we
was gettin' along pretty likely, when one day Gabriel blew his horn for
Anna, and Gabe was lef' alone.
""My ol' woman's gone. Li'l Missy, mos' ev'y one I knowed is daid. Dis
heah cabin ain' home to me no mo'. Hits lonely ev'y whar. Maybe I'd
orter be thinkin' 'bout Canaan, but hits ol' times crowds dis ol'
darkey's heart. Li'l Missy, may be whin I gits to whar Anna is hit will
be ol' times all ovah ag'in.""","Interview with Gabe Hines

Gertha Couric, Eufaula, Alabama
Aunt Josephine claims to be the oldest Negro in Eufaula. She says she
was born ninety-four years ago in North Georgia on a plantation above
Atlanta. She lives now in Eufaula, Alabama with a great-granddaughter.
""I used to belong to Marse Rogers,"" she said. ""After surrender, Marse
Rogers moved to dis country, and bought a plantation 'twixt Marse Josiah
Flourney's and General Toney's. He said his plantation j'ined theirs.""
She was a nurse-maid all of her life, even in Slave days, and never was
a ""field nigger."" Asked if she saw any soldiers during the war she said
she saw ""thousands.""
""I and my Mistis and her baby hid in de swamps three days while Sherman
and his army was passin' through,"" she explained. ""Marse Rogers was in
Virginny and when he got back home, there wasn't nothin' left but a
well. Everything had been burned up. His house was gone and so was de
smoke house; everything."" She added that the well was a ""dry well"" where
melons and butter and milk and meats were placed, in Summer, to keep
them cool.
""Those three days my little brother hid in this well, while the soldiers
were passin',"" she said.
""'Fore God, Missy,"" she exclaimed, ""when we got dat little nigger out ob
dat well, he had almost turned white!""
Aunt Josephine is still a ""nurse maid."" She rocks her
great-great-great-grandchildren.","Interview with Josephine

Interview with Theodore Fontaine Stewart

Gertha Couric, [HW: Eufaula]
""De years are mighty long widout Lottie, Massa. She done gone on to de
promise; but I knows she wid Jesus. And us gwine 'er walk dem golden
streets together holdin' hands.""
Uncle Theodore Fontaine Stewart lives alone in a weather-beaten,
one-room Eufaula shanty. It is clean and surrounded by flowers. In the
rear is a small garden; and there you will find Uncle Stewart when the
dawn is fresh or the dusk is coolly approaching.
""Lottie been gone away nigh onto twenty-two year now, Massa. Her was a
good woman; one of de best de Lord ever sont to de earth.""
He paused to think when the interviewer asked his age.
""It hard fer me to tell 'bout dat,"" he said, ""but I knows I'se well past
de ninety mark. I guess I'se gwine on a hundred, caze I was borned 'fore
de war an' was a right peart boy at de surrender.""
""What about slavery times, Uncle Stewart?""
He mused a moment, his black fingers gently caressing the buttons on his
rust-colored old vest.
""I 'members all 'bout dem times,"" he said, ""an' de Lord know dey was
better times den we got now, for white or black. Nobody was hongry den,
Massa, and peoples didn't git in de devilment dey gits in now. Folks
went to de church an' 'haved demselves in dose days.
""Who was my Ol' Marster?"" He looked at the interviewer a moment,
answered proudly, ""Why, he was de riches' man in Georgy. I knows you has
heard of Marse Theodore Fontaine. He had three big plantations and mo'
niggers dan he could count. He moved clost to Florence, an' his three
places was so big you couldn't see 'crost de littlest field.
""Ol' Marster he lib in a big house, bigger dan any meetin'-house in
Eufaula. He had a gang of fine horses, an' when company was dar he had
horse races on his own track. His horses could beat all de horses
brought dar, an' dat's de direc' trufe.""
Uncle Stewart filled a blackened old corncob pipe with tobacco,
continued:
""Ol' Marster, he didn't go to de war. He too ol' to go, so he stay home
an' make corn an' fodder an' oats an' sen' dem to de soldiers what
killin' Yankees. One day de Yankees come along an' burnt up everything
on de place, 'cept de nigger cabins. Dey took all de horses and
everything us had to eat.
""Ol' Marster went off somewhar when dey come; I don't 'member where; an'
when he come back he had to live in one of de nigger cabins 'twel he
could build a house. But de new one wasn't big lak de old one.
""My pappy was a fiel' han' 'twel one time Ol' Marster put him on a horse
to ride in a race, an' pappy beat de other horse so far Ol' Marster was
tickled pink. He said a nigger what could ride lak dat had no bizness in
de fiel', so he made a stable boy outen pappy.
Theodore Fontaine Stewart, Eufaula, Alabama
""Ol' Marster didn't have no Ol' Mistus. He say he so big all de little
ladies look funny 'side of him. When company was dar his sisters, Mistus
Mary an' Mistus Lucy, come an' kep' house; but dey lef' when de company
did.
""My pappy was name Ed Stewart, caze Ol' Marster buy him from a Stewart.
Atter de war dey call pappy's chilluns Stewart; but us is Fontaines by
right, bet yo' life on dat.
""Ol' Marster was good to de niggers, but his overseers was mean.
Ol' Marster fired dem atter awhile an' got some good overseers. He
didn't 'low dem to whip a nigger 'cept when he say, an' he didn't say
so much.
""My mammy was name' Sarah, an' her an' pappy stayed right wid Ol'
Marster when de surrender come. Dey was right in de room when Ol'
Marster died, an' dey cried something awful. Us all stayed dar 'twel
pappy an' mammy die; den us chilluns split up an' went everywhere.
""Mammy an' pappy had ten head o' chilluns sides me, but I don' know whar
dey at now. Mammy raise all her chilluns right, an', long as I knowed
dem, none of dem ever got in a jailhouse.
""Mammy didn't 'low her chilluns to steal. Her was Ol' Marster's house
cook, an' when she kotch any of us takin' things from de kitchen, she
sho' did tan us hides wid a brush.
""Me an' Carlotta; us calls her Lottie; was married in de ol' Mount Maria
church, whar all de niggers went to meetin' every Sunday. Us had fo'
chillun, two gals an' two boys; but dey all dead now 'cept de las' boy,
an I ain't heard frum him since 'fore his mammy died.
""Yes, Massa, her was a good woman. It won't be long now 'fore us will
walk dem golden streets han' in han'.""","Interview with Theodore Fontaine Stewart
